That's not easy, nor is it a very heartening conclusion when democracies are sliding backwards everywhere, as the <a href="http://www.eiu.com/Handlers/WhitepaperHandler.ashx?fi=Democracy_Index_2010_Web.pdf&amp;mode=wp">Economist Intelligence Unit concluded in 2010</a> in a report entitled 'Democracy index 2010: Democracy in retreat'.

The table below ranks the top ten democracies according to</p><p>the EIU report I have just cited.</p><p>Then I've drawn on the first serious sustainability index I found, also for 2010, the <a href="http://carbonpig.com/article/10-most-sustainable-countries-world">Environmental Performance Index 2010</a> produced by Yale and Columbia Universities.</p><p>I'm also interested in equality and how that correlates to democracy and sustainability performance, so I'm going to add a column for that as well, from the <a href="http://www.visionofhumanity.org/gpi-data/#/2010/GINI">Global Peace Index</a> which draws from the UNDP Human Development Index.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sustainability leaders (2010)</strong></td><td><strong>Full democracy leaders (2010)</strong></td><td><strong>Income equality leaders</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Iceland (full democracy)</td><td>Norway</td><td>Denmark (full democracy)</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland (full)</td><td>Iceland</td><td>Japan (full)</td></tr><tr><td>Costa Rica (full)</td><td>Denmark</td><td>Iceland (full)</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden (full)</td><td>Sweden</td><td>Sweden (full)</td></tr><tr><td>Norway (full)</td><td>New Zealand</td><td>Czech Republic (full)</td></tr><tr><td>Mauritius (full)</td><td>Australia</td><td>Norway (full)</td></tr><tr><td>France (full)</td><td>Finland</td><td>Slovakia (flawed)</td></tr><tr><td>Austria (full)</td><td>Switzerland</td><td>Finland (full)</td></tr><tr><td>Cuba (authoritarian)</td><td>Canada</td><td>Belarus (authoritarian)</td></tr><tr><td>Colombia (flawed)</td><td>Netherlands</td><td>Ukraine (flawed)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Looking at this list, four of the world's sustainability leaders are also democracy leaders. Austria, Costa Rica and Mauritius are not top ten democracies, but they are also listed by the EIU as full democracies. So seven of the 10 sustainability leaders are full democracies. France and Colombia (like South Africa, ranked 30 most democratic) are flawed democracies – only Cuba is an authoritarian regime.</p><p>To me at least, this snapshot study very strongly suggests that the more democratic a country is, the more likely it is a sustainability leader.</p><p>The implications of this are pretty straightforward: trying to persuade policymakers to take <a href="http://www.stockholmresilience.org/planetary-boundaries">climate change and other environmental crises</a> seriously is likely pretty damn difficult where democracy is weak.</p><p>As corporate power has advanced and democracy has weakened in the United States in the last couple of years, so climate change has slid down the agenda there. If Obama is a philosopher king, he's certainly not been a massive asset to the environmental movement.</p><p>Looking at the inequality figures I've drawn in as a secondary argument, there seems to be a fairly high level of correlation between sustainability, democracy and income equality. (Note that income equality is not the same as wealth equality.)</p><p>Interesting to note that the countries that are arguably noisiest about 'promoting democracy' – the US and UK – are not in fact its leading practical exponents...</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on July 31, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/tags/democracy-log/">Democracy log</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdavidlepage.github.io%2Ffor-more-sustainability-add-democracy%2F" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=For%20more%20sustainability%2C%20add%20democracy https%3A%2F%2Fdavidlepage.github.io%2Ffor-more-sustainability-add-democracy%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/authors/david-le-page/" rel="author">David Le Page</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/the-indigenous-forester-of-smutsville/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The indigenous forester of Smutsville</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/the-wonder-and-hope-of-planetary-ecological-restoration/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The wonder and hope of planetary ecological restoration</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/authors/david-le-page/" class="feed__author">David Le Page</a> <time datetime="2013-07-02T18:52" class="feed__date">July 2, 2013</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/sa-must-build-economic-democracy/">&#x27;SA must build economic democracy&#x27;</a></h3></header><p><em><a title="Link to article on the M&amp;G website" href="http://mg.co.za/article/2013-06-21-00-sa-must-build-economic-democracy">Published</a> in the Mail &amp; Guardian, 21 June 2013</em></p><figure class="alignright size-medium wp-image-636"><img loading="lazy" src="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/45/p8073931.jpg" alt="This is not Constantia." width="300" height="156" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/p8073931-xs.jpg 640w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/p8073931-sm.jpg 768w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/p8073931-md.jpg 1024w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/p8073931-lg.jpg 1366w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/p8073931-xl.jpg 1600w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/p8073931-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure>Twenty years after this country chose to end relentless violence and injustice by introducing political democracy, our rightwing government is ready to roll out the troops and subdue mineworkers by force of arms. But the only lasting remedy for the discontent on the mines is to make South Africa an economic democracy.<p></p><p>Currently, South Africa is being crushed by economic totalitarianism. Few of us realise this, and few of us know that there are alternatives, many of them up and running in other countries.</p><p>Economic democracy is about ensuring that everyone in society, not just the elites, has a meaningful share in the wealth of the country, and a voice in deciding how that wealth is shared. It’s a term that has emerged from nearly two centuries of worker mobilisation in Europe, the United States and Latin America.</p><p>It’s particularly necessary in South Africa because of our history of colonialism and apartheid. To paraphrase Walter Rodney, most South Africans are not underdeveloped, they have been underdeveloped. This means that real development will be impossible so long as the institutions responsible for underdevelopment persist.</p><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/sa-must-build-economic-democracy/" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/authors/david-le-page/" class="feed__author">David Le Page</a> <time datetime="2012-11-18T15:06" class="feed__date">November 18, 2012</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/our-democracy-needs-a-major-acccountability-service/">Our democracy needs a major acccountability service</a></h3></header><p><em>Published in </em><a href="http://www.informante.co.za/">Informanté</a><em>, November 2012</em></p><figure class="wp-image alignleft"><a href="http://lepage.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mvc-logo.png"><img loading="lazy" id="i-550" src="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/42/mvc-logo.png" alt="Image" width="297" height="205" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/42/responsive/mvc-logo-xs.png 640w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/42/responsive/mvc-logo-sm.png 768w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/42/responsive/mvc-logo-md.png 1024w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/42/responsive/mvc-logo-lg.png 1366w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/42/responsive/mvc-logo-xl.png 1600w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/42/responsive/mvc-logo-2xl.png 1920w"></a></figure>You’ve probably heard it said a hundred times that South Africa has one of the world’s best constitutions. But do we have the world’s best parliament? Hm...<p></p><p>So what would a really great parliament look like?</p><p>Well, we’d probably have members of parliament (MPs) who run strong constituency offices and are visible in the communities they represent. They would be standing up regularly for the rights of the vulnerable. Like MPs in the UK and members of congress in the US, they’d have no hesitation in criticising the leaders of their own parties or big businesses that abuse their power and influence. But unlike US congresspeople, they would not be receiving enormous amounts of money from special interests and handing out endless favours in return. Unlike the British government, they would not be giving more attention to the needs of bankers than to those of ordinary people.</p><p>We have good people in our parliament, but who knows of a South African MP like that? Anyone? So why don’t we have a parliament like that?</p><p>A big problem is that our current institutions</p><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/our-democracy-needs-a-major-acccountability-service/" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

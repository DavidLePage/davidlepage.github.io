Much of it, I fear, is at present crashingly dull: notices of conferences, scholarships and funding opportunities, lightened (if that is the word) by a heady mixture of endless announcements by aid organisations, governments and other earnest twiddlers of the knobs of continental development. These announcements are rarely if ever accompanied by statements of past achievements or measurable targets, and so far my efforts to discover just how much is achieved, and when, and where, are proving frustrating.</p><p>I have gained new insight into just how much aid and development is designed without consulting Africans, how much those running these organisations like to patronise Africans, and how self-interested much of this purported benevolence really is.</p><p>But the attempt to uncover these things, at least, is enjoyable.</p><p>My contract with Research Africa ends on 20

We must hope truth will emerge, for the truth is a hard thing to come by when it concerns the global addiction to fossil fuels.</p><p>The danger posed by further carbon emissions is now so great, and the evidence for that danger now so overwhelming, that any proposal to expand fossil-fuel production - not least the natural gas exploitation plans of Shell, Sasol and others in the Karoo - should now be regarded as a crime against humanity.</p><p>When government licenses continued fossil-fuel production - in the absence of an absolute commitment to a low or zero-carbon economy - it, too, is committing a crime against humanity. And when the media fail to communicate this crisis, they are complicit in crimes against humanity.</p><p>South Africa hosts companies that claim to be concerned about climate change - yet their international colleagues fund climate change deniers in the US Congress. Such behaviour, by ArcelorMittal, BP, Bayer and others, is dangerous and disgraceful. <a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/sunday-times-stop-these-crimes-against-humanity.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></p></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/authors/david-le-page/" class="feed__author">David Le Page</a> <time datetime="2002-11-18T20:50" class="feed__date">November 18, 2002</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/a-briefing-against-war-on-iraq.html">A briefing against war on Iraq</a></h3></header><p><em>First published on an earlier blog on 18 November 2002, months before the actual invasion of Iraq.

My own pic.<p></p><p><strong>I: Cute notion, but neither fashionable nor persuasive. Try again.</strong></p><p>P: There are many arguments, and many who argue, against war on Iraq. There are a very few courageous souls who do so on the basis that war might actually be An Inherently Very Bad Thing, or even Wrong. Are they correct? Confusion on this point has beset humanity for too long. But let us (copping-out perhaps) stick to practical arguments against war â there are more than enough of them.</p><p>All wars are messy and brutal, cause death and great suffering and have nasty unforeseen consequences. A war on Iraq will be no exception.</p><p><strong>I: Surely the consequences of allowing Saddam Hussein to continue as World's Nastiest Dictator will be great suffering if he is allowed to continue amassing, and uses, weapons of mass destruction?</strong></p><p>P: If he attempted war, he would face overwhelming military force from the US and allies. He leads a moderately-sized country with a devastated economy, and armed forces stuck, for the most part, with ageing military technology. He cannot possibly hope to gain anything from going to war.</p><p>The CIA considers the risks of an unprovoked attack by Iraq on the US "low", but suggests he might lash out with WMDs in advance of an imminent US attack (thus preempting the preempters). <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031022194705/http://www.bluegreenprint.co.za/bgparchives/tenet">(32)</a></p><p><strong>I: Saddam went to war with Iran in the 1980s, and invaded Kuwait in 1990. He's waged brutal war internally against the Kurds and marsh Arabs. What's to stop him doing it all over again?</strong></p><p>P: He has shown no signs of external aggression since the Gulf War. His means of waging war are smaller than during the Gulf War; the US has spent another 10 years developing ever more sophisticated weapons. He can have no doubt that any external attack would end in overwhelming defeat. His regime, morally bankrupt as it is, is a state. States tend to behave far more rationally, particularly with respect to self-preservation, than the likes of al Quaeda. They can be, and are, deterred by the threat of force. His motives for hanging onto weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), if he is, are now probably the same as US motives for having such weapons: he wants to deter attack (being none too popular with the neighbours).</p><p>It has been argued that Saddam only invaded Kuwait on the nod from then US Ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie. In other words, that the US is directly responsible for one of his major acts of past aggression.</p><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/a-briefing-against-war-on-iraq.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

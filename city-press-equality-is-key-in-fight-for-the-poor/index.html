A recent study in the US by Princeton economist Angus Deaton and psychologist Daniel Kahneman shows that there is an optimum income for “day-to-day contentment”, $75 000 (about R522,000) yearly, after which increases in income contribute only to making people feel more important than others.</p><p>If the super-rich really value the lives of their children and grandchildren, they should also be lobbying for greater income equality.</p><p>Some German millionaires have set a precedent here, as has Bill Gates' wealthy father, arguing that they should be taxed more.</p><p>Increases in progressive taxes are indeed among the remedies we need; along with more employee ownership, more co-operatively owned companies (an often extremely successful model) and increases in the minimum wage.</p><p>Minimum wage increases are often opposed on the grounds that they reduce employment.</p><p>Yet, according to Philip, international experience now suggests that it’s not “employment levels per se that make the difference to either poverty or inequality, rather it’s the quality of employment that matters and the quality of social protection where employment fails”.</p><p><em>Correction: In the version of this story published by City Press, I mentioned that Bill Gates has argued that the rich in the US should be taxed more; it is in fact his father, Bill Gates Snr, who has made this argument.</em></p><p>For more information on poverty and inequality in South Africa, visit the <a href="http://www.spii.org.za/">Institute for Studies in Poverty and Inequality</a> and the <a href="http://www.plaas.org.za/">Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (PLAAS)</a>.

The issue is in the news every day, bloggers have launched an online reporting initiative called the Meerkat Corruption Project, newspapers are beefing up their investigative units... and it might all be pointless.</p><p>We shouldn’t feel too insecure about our corruption in comparison to some other nations. The United States Congress is a filthy stew of special interests that makes a mockery of “We, the people” and compromises not just the interests and wellbeing of ordinary Americans, but of the whole world. US warmongering is a murderous subsidy system for the military-industrial complex; US climate imperialism threatens the entire human race to preserve the pollution “rights” of American fossil fuel interests. (Obama’s leading economic adviser, Larry Summers, believes Africa is “under-polluted”.)</p><p>No bill passes Congress these days without being laden with appropriations called “earmarks”, really payoffs to the favourite special interests of individual legislators. Corrupt US legislators are currently refusing to pass legislation either to ease US unemployment or to reduce the universal threat of climate change.</p><p>So the US is hardly less corrupt than we are, but its rulers are better at corruption: they've written it into law and spin it well. So too, to a good degree, the British. Tony Blair supported the illegal Iraq war, blocked enquiries into dodgy arms deals, and appears to have released the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing in order to secure access to Libyan oil for BP. No envelopes of cash need have changed hands for us to call this corrupt.</p><p>But struggling young democracies should not or seek find consolation in the failures of the old.

Our programme laid a strong emphasis on the business implications – and opportunities – presented by the crisis.</p><p>Milliband offered a succinct summary of the importance of Copenhagen: "I think it's quite simple in the end, this Copenhagen thing. It comes down to, are developed countries going to take on ambitious commitments including for the mid-term 2025, are developing countries going to show deviation from business as usual, get off the high-carbon path, not yet cuts in emissions but at least slower growth in emissions; and are we going to find a financial architecture or settlement that can help developing countries adapt to climate change and to move onto that low-carbon path."</p><p>The response to this event was extremely positive, and we are developing follow-up plans. But clearly, for most SA editors, climate change remains a niche science/environment story, siloed well away from business and economic news. I have yet to realise my dream of seeing a climate change story make front page headlines in this country; but hopefully we may yet get there this year.</p><p>Below, some of the news stories that flowed from the event, though generating news was not in itself a priority.</p><p><a href="http://www.businessday.co.za/Articles/Content.aspx?id=77988">Business Day: Long Road to Copenhagen</a></p><p><a href="http://www.businessday.co.za/Articles/Content.aspx?id=77990">Business Day: SA three years from carbon plan</a></p><p><a href="http://www.polity.org.za/article/low-carbon-high-growth-trajectory-possible-says-uks-miliband-2009-08-07-1">Polity: Low carbon, high-growth trajectory possible, says UK’s Milliband</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/climate-change-can-present-opportunity-to-move-into-new-growth-areas-csir-2009-08-07">Engineering News: Climate change presents opportunity to move into new growth areas – CSIR</a></p><p><a href="http://www.weekendpost.co.za/article.aspx?id=455558">Weekend Post: ‘Weather on steroids’ will bring mega-storms to E Cape – expert</a></p><p><a href="//www.mg.co.za/article/2009-09-12-the-invisible-refugee">Mail &amp; Guardian: The invisible refugeee</a></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on July 31, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fgetting-the-climate-change-asteroid-onto-page-one.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Getting%20the%20climate%20change%20asteroid%20onto%20page%20one %23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fgetting-the-climate-change-asteroid-onto-page-one.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="./authors/david-le-page/" rel="author">David Le Page</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="./thesaurus-publishers-salute-zuma-cabinet-restructuring.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> ‘Thesaurus publishers salute Zuma cabinet restructuring’</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="./fired-up-by-cleaner-coal.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> ‘Fired up by cleaner coal’</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./authors/david-le-page/" class="feed__author">David Le Page</a> <time datetime="2012-10-16T07:58" class="feed__date">October 16, 2012</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="./groundup-the-immense-danger-and-opportunity-of-climate-change.html">Groundup: &#x27;The immense danger and opportunity of climate change&#x27;</a></h3></header><figure class="alignright size-full wp-image-544"><a href="./media/posts/41/sandy-and-earth-300x300.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="Hurricane Sandy approaches the US before wreaking havoc.

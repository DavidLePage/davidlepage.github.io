During the second world war, <a title="Link to New Yorker article, The Price of Valor" href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/07/12/040712fa_fact?currentPage=all">it was discovered by careful application of scientific methodology</a>, neutral as ever, that even when in mortal danger, <a title="Link to a post on my blog about Harry Patch, one of the last survivors of WWI, and Slam Marshall" href="http://lepageblog.wordpress.com/2009/09/01/harry-patch-slam-marshall-and-the-death-of-humanity/">nine out of ten American soldiers could not bring themselves to actually shoot their opponents</a>. Generals were appalled by this revelation of inefficiency. To increase kill rates, new ingenuity in dehumanisation was required: but the US military has been equal to the task, more than, and has learned to effectively weaponise human mind and tissue. There is a trite lesson there, of course: to kill human beings, we have to first kill humanity.</p><div class="caption" style="width: 260px; float: right; font-size: .8em; text-align: center;"><figure class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48"><img loading="lazy" src="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/10/saddam_hussein.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="296" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/saddam_hussein-xs.jpg 640w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/saddam_hussein-sm.jpg 768w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/saddam_hussein-md.jpg 1024w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/saddam_hussein-lg.jpg 1366w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/saddam_hussein-xl.jpg 1600w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/saddam_hussein-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure>Saddam in his last days</div><p>Having done so, and helped others in emulating it, that same US military is, taken by itself, now the world’s biggest socialist state. To defeat – by looming – the former eastern bloc it became what it wished to destroy: a vast and ruthless command economy entirely devoid of market.</p><p>These were thoughts I could not convey to Saddam at the time: he was soon busy with ignominious retreat, sanctions, dismantling so it turned out his crueler armories, watching children die, the nitty-gritty itsy minutiae of modern tyranny. I watched his army’s desert scrabblings, burnings and dyings, and was glad I was someone else’s conscript.</p><p>Was he master of his destiny? Or is becoming dictator to throw away all hope of escaping a prison of fear: barred by terror: your own and others? Fear one is too scared to feel.</p><p>Could it be that with more and more power, there are fewer and fewer choices? That our hierarchical societies, however constructed, imprison those at the top? Who then revenge themselves on those who by ballot or default set them up?</p><p>More thoughts I never had a chance to share. The Kuwait thing was a debacle; but then, war always is. Saddam retreated behind a wall of propaganda and sanctions, he became the lynchpin of other’s righteousness, and so was more indispensable than ever. Indispensable, that is, till inadvertently revealed to be mostly bogey. Who now can fill his shoes, who can credibly carry our darkness?</p><p>We might not seem to have much in common, but I understand he did a little gardening in his last days, a distraction from the amusements of his trial, and I too know what it is like to anchor oneself against the void with seeds and soil and sunlight.</p><p>I should like to have exchanged notes on gardening in hot, dry, barren places – Baghdad, no doubt, much harsher, than the north slopes of Table Mountain in summer. Did he mulch? Recycle kitchen waste and grey water?</p><p>And if we had conversed, would my small gestures of ordinariness have taken root, or been washed away by cruelty, cynicism and fear? A shy man, with a limp handshake, one writer says. Probably he would have been most terrified by friendship.</p><p>Can one recycle a dictator? Surely it must be possible. Nurse aide, gardener, or if popular tastes demand it, sewerage maintenance technician. More elegant revenges suggest themselves: demanding he clean the blood and shit and filth of fear and death from every cell his torturers used, from Kirkuk to Basra to Tikrit: the penitence of imagination. No, more, let him hear out the rage and pain of every one of his victims. Execution – disposal without re-use – is dull, unjust and most unfashionable.</p><p>But – revealed to be a straw man, a constant reminder of the embarrassment of those had insisted he was so to be feared, he had to be dispatched. Swept incomplete off the workbench by those now needing – oh dear – another project to engage geopolitical hubris.</p><p>At his execution, someone shouted, ‘Go to hell!’ He replied: ‘The hell that is Iraq?’</p><p>Only at the end do we get to appreciate irony in dictators.</p><p>He was hanged in public. The skewed head and a large rope knot lit against the dark was seen by millions, thanks to the prurience of cameraphone and media. He had never attacked those who catalyzed his lynching, only taken their lead, after a cycle of seduction and abuse that must have echoed strangely for him whatever weird alchemy of learning and battering first made him deadly.</p><p>What is more evil, I wonder? A war prosecuted by those who fear a tyrant, or one prosecuted by the freely enlisted and deployed by the will or lazy acquiescence of the people?</p><p>We have mostly abandoned cock-fighting, bear-baiting, goat-scaping and turned to tormenting tyrants – but since all peoples are more indivisible than they may seem, this new pleasure demands tormenting entire nations. Denied our older tortures, we have turned the vast leverage of democracy and proxy to killing, maiming and ever-so gently persecuting on a scale we never managed when pitting brute against beast in little circus.</p><p>Now the world is the circus. There is no escape. We are all in the arena, shuffling ignominiously behind each other.</p><p>Rest in peace, Saddam, for a moment. I will see you again soon. At present, we insist on it.</p><p>(c) David Le Page 2007</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on August 4, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/tags/personal-notes/">Personal</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdavidlepage.github.io%2Fmy-relationship-with-saddam-hussein%2F" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=My%20relationship%20with%20Saddam%C2%A0Hussein https%3A%2F%2Fdavidlepage.github.io%2Fmy-relationship-with-saddam-hussein%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/authors/david-le-page/" rel="author">David Le Page</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/a-footnote-on-electoral-systems/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> A footnote on electoral systems</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/walking-near-the-goukamma/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Walking near the Goukamma</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/authors/david-le-page/" class="feed__author">David Le Page</a> <time datetime="2013-01-23T15:25" class="feed__date">January 23, 2013</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/fix-inequality-with-a-maximum-wage/">Fix inequality with a maximum wage</a></h3></header><figure class="size-medium wp-image-587"><a href="http://lepage.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/pc039652.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/44/pc039652.jpg" alt="'Toilets, washbasins and geysers last maintained by apartheid.'

That’s real solidarity.</p><p>But since we’re not yet seeing that kind of solidarity here, let’s talk frankly about two things: Firstly, the ways in which the very existence of excessive wealth actually creates poverty, and secondly, what some real solutions might look like.</p><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/fix-inequality-with-a-maximum-wage/" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/authors/david-le-page/" class="feed__author">David Le Page</a> <time datetime="2011-11-23T12:42" class="feed__date">November 23, 2011</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/south-africa-slowly-shredding-democracy-in-line-with-international-best-practice/">South Africa slowly shredding democracy, in line with international best practice</a></h3></header><figure class="alignright size-medium wp-image-337">Following yesterday’s <a href="http://mg.co.za/article/2011-11-22-black-tuesday-secrecy-bill-passed-by-parliament">passage by the National Assembly of the Protection of State Information Bill</a>, and the Black Tuesday campaign’s comparison with the days of apartheid, there’s been a lot of discussion about whether ‘this takes us back to the dark days of apartheid’.

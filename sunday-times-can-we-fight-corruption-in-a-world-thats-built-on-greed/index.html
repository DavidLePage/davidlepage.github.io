No envelopes of cash need have changed hands for us to call this corrupt.</p><p>But struggling young democracies should not or seek find consolation in the failures of the old. Rather, we need to</p><p>ask deeper questions about the real roots of corruption in our society.</p><p>The comparison with the US and the UK is essential – because while we pay lip service to ubuntu, we are in fact a proud outpost of Anglo American-style capitalism.</p><p>The Eastern and European flavours of capitalism retain some respect for society, at least their own. But Anglo American capitalism has unique contempt for economic equality. And extreme and growing inequality, exploitation and elitism, the hallmarks of Anglo American capitalism, are the real roots of South African corruption.</p><p>We can investigate, publish and protest till the cows come home, we could double the numbers of our police force and prosecutors and investigative journalists – and perhaps we should – but we will not make a lasting dent in the corruption problem until we commit ourselves to becoming a fair society. For in an unfair society, the naked self-interest we call corruption is in fact quite rational. If society does not offer us security, and ours does not, we will always try to seize it for ourselves.</p><p>The great magic of the World Cup at its best was that for a few weeks, we had a glimpse of what a more generous, trusting society would be like. Surely at least 90% of us would like to create that society? What do we need to do?</p><p>“Society and the world will change when political and economic leaders develop a genuine spirit of gratitude and service toward the people,” writes the Buddhist Daisaku Ikeda. I suspect there are many in government and business who would like to have that spirit, but are caught up despite themselves in the materialism that disfigures our leaders.</p><p>We need far greater generosity on the part of the wealthy and powerful. Some German millionaires have recently been lobbying to be taxed more, as has Bill Gates. This is not an impulse that seems to move wealthy South Africans, for all that they love a bit of token social responsibility and a glitzy fundraiser.</p><p>Real social responsibility means spending on and strengthening the perennial social goods of health, education, public transport and justice: these must be far better funded by more progressive taxes. Our society cannot afford to prioritise spending on big polluting cars, second homes and an ocean of transient consumer goods.</p><p>As has often been suggested, South African lawmakers should be obliged to use the health and education services of which they are the stewards.</p><p>White South Africans need to question their continuing privilege and must cease sweeping discussions of national reconciliation under the rug.</p><p>Black-led local government must stop treating the poor with contempt and brutality: examples abound.</p><p>We need to ditch knee-jerk calls for economic growth, and start asking what kinds of growth we want.</p><p>Pay scales should be adjusted so that top executives never earn more than ten times what their least paid subordinates receive. This is hardly radical – it was the norm in most countries until 30 years ago.</p><p>Our media must also step up: it has only the shallowest sense of responsibility for social health. It has been described internationally as “right wing”, and justly so. This is not because journalists (when white) hanker after apartheid or are secret racists, but because the media as a whole promotes an environmentally and socially destructive bling consumerism, criticising conspicuous consumption in the corrupt and selfish while advertising it furiously.</p><p>South African media worship the interests of business over the interests of society. Just one example: the high priests we call corporate economists get to lead most strike reports, spouting indignantly over “losses to the economy”. But unjustly low wages and poor working conditions also cause economic losses, and the spouting is usually, really, about costs to business.</p><p>Politicians sense the hypocrisy of being called to account for corruption by a media that does not take deep responsibility for creating a better society. Little wonder there is now such bad blood between the media and political classes.</p><p>But creating a truly fair society is the responsibility of all of us. For all that we may be superficially nice to each other, one has only to spend time behind the wheel of a car to get a sense of South Africans’ real mutual contempt. A fair and honest society will begin with respect, and with all of us taking less and giving more.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on August 4, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/tags/economics-log/">Economics</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdavidlepage.github.io%2Fsunday-times-can-we-fight-corruption-in-a-world-thats-built-on-greed%2F" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Sunday%20Times%3A%20'Can%20we%20fight%20corruption%20in%20a%20world%20that's%20built%20on%20greed%3F' https%3A%2F%2Fdavidlepage.github.io%2Fsunday-times-can-we-fight-corruption-in-a-world-thats-built-on-greed%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/authors/david-le-page/" rel="author">David Le Page</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/south-africa-is-dying-of-growth/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> South Africa is dying of growth</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/mandampg-getting-our-greenhouse-in-order/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> M&amp;G: &#x27;Getting our greenhouse in order&#x27;</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><figure class="feed__image related__image"><img src="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/12v-micro-solar-system.jpeg" srcset="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/12v-micro-solar-system-xs.jpeg 640w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/12v-micro-solar-system-sm.jpeg 768w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/12v-micro-solar-system-md.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 600px) calc(4.38vw + 143px), 87.86vw" loading="lazy" height="1575" width="2100" alt="The heart of my 12 volt micro solar system – a 33 amp hour lead acid gel battery, charge controller and 12 volt power hub.

We must hope truth will emerge, for the truth is a hard thing to come by when it concerns the global addiction to fossil fuels.</p><p>The danger posed by further carbon emissions is now so great, and the evidence for that danger now so overwhelming, that any proposal to expand fossil-fuel production - not least the natural gas exploitation plans of Shell, Sasol and others in the Karoo - should now be regarded as a crime against humanity.</p><p>When government licenses continued fossil-fuel production - in the absence of an absolute commitment to a low or zero-carbon economy - it, too, is committing a crime against humanity. And when the media fail to communicate this crisis, they are complicit in crimes against humanity.</p><p>South Africa hosts companies that claim to be concerned about climate change - yet their international colleagues fund climate change deniers in the US Congress.

In fact, rich people are rapidly becoming even more of a danger to themselves. So it's little wonder that rich people have been queueing up to endorse Cosatu boss Zwelinzima Vavi's recent call for a tax on the super-rich ... oh, but they haven't. So why should they be? The fact is that all the evidence and experience of other countries that have succeeded in building more sustainable and healthy societies suggests that a class of super-rich people is not part of the solution. Our rich should declare their interests: are they for South Africa, or just for themselves?</p><p>Noting October as Social Development Month, the ANC has called for an intensification of the "war on poverty". Indeed, the government is making efforts to deal with poverty, such as the Community Work Programme now managed from the Department of Co-operative Governance. But to truly deal with our many social afflictions, the government is going to have to get to grips with the effects of our country being host to a class of super-rich people.</p><p>What are those effects?

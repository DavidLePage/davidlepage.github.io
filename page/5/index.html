The biggest part of that work was researching and writing a section on Luthuli's legacy. In pursuit of a more intimate understanding of one of South Africa's greatest leaders, and the continent's first Nobel Peace Prize winner, I interviewed some of those who still remember him in person: Ben Turok, one of the last Treason Trialists still in Parliament; Pallo Jordan, a former ANC exile, cabinet minister and renowned historian; and Ela Gandhi, grand-daughter of Mahatma Gandhi, and daughter to Manilal Gandhi, who was a close associate of Luthuli.<p></p><p>It was amazing to meet and talk to these three veterans of South African struggle history, and to build up through their eyes, an image of a truly remarkable man. Though Mandela's legacy perhaps now outshines Luthuli in popular memory, the latter was certainly no less remarkable.</p><p>One of the key questions about the life of Luthuli is the extent to which he did, or didn't, support the beginning of the armed struggle against apartheid, led by Mandela. It is clear that while a deep commitment to non-violence was more than just a strategic principle for Luthuli, a man of profound Christian faith who was inspired by Gandhi, it seems it also became impossible for him to stand against the pressure of oppression and hatred of oppression that eventually precipitated the armed struggle.</p><a href="./../../voices-of-liberation-albert-luthuli.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./../../authors/david-le-page/" class="feed__author">David Le Page</a> <time datetime="2012-02-21T22:31" class="feed__date">February 21, 2012</time></div><h2 class="feed__title"><a href="./../../the-wonder-and-hope-of-planetary-ecological-restoration.html">The wonder and hope of planetary ecological restoration</a></h2></header><figure class="size-medium wp-image-405"><a href="./../../media/posts/37/pc1198501.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="Restored dunes at Durban's North Beach" src="./../../media/posts/37/pc1198501.jpg" alt="Replacing a sea front that used to be concrete, restored dunes now protect the shore at Durban's North Beach." width="300" height="208" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./../../media/posts/37/responsive/pc1198501-xs.jpg 640w, ./../../media/posts/37/responsive/pc1198501-sm.jpg 768w, ./../../media/posts/37/responsive/pc1198501-md.jpg 1024w, ./../../media/posts/37/responsive/pc1198501-lg.jpg 1366w, ./../../media/posts/37/responsive/pc1198501-xl.jpg 1600w, ./../../media/posts/37/responsive/pc1198501-2xl.jpg 1920w"></a></figure><p></p><p>How do we heal the planet, <a title="Mother Earth – the phrase comes from the indigenous peoples movements of Latin America.

Which can make keeping one's psychological moorings intact quite difficult (something under-estimated, I suspect, by most employers in the environmental sector). I often seek mental anchorage in the growing movement for ecological restoration, which the eco-technocrats sometimes call ecosystems-based adaptation, and permaculture – "you can solve all the world's problems in a garden", says one of its leading lights.

That's not easy, nor is it a very heartening conclusion when democracies are sliding backwards everywhere, as the <a href="http://www.eiu.com/Handlers/WhitepaperHandler.ashx?fi=Democracy_Index_2010_Web.pdf&amp;mode=wp">Economist Intelligence Unit concluded in 2010</a> in a report entitled 'Democracy index 2010: Democracy in retreat'.

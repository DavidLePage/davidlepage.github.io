After all, the pillars of “the West” include all too many countries that engaged in colonialism and genocide themselves until the middle of the last century.<sup class=\"fn\" data-fn=\"10f8a01b-35ff-4f84-82e4-c8eaf8e7787e\"><a href=\"#10f8a01b-35ff-4f84-82e4-c8eaf8e7787e\" id=\"10f8a01b-35ff-4f84-82e4-c8eaf8e7787e-link\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Now we see genocidal levels of killing by Israel – of an order that would never be tolerated for an anti-terrorist operation in New York, Berlin or London – given free license by these Western powers, who parade the fiction that they have no real control over Israeli actions when they could pull the plug on the arms and financial pipelines to Israel very quickly if they wanted to, as sanctions on Russia demonstrate; even quicker, because Russia was not receiving direct “aid”.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Western politicians and media are blind to their own racism because they think or pretend to think that racism is all about crude insults and outlandish bigotry, and pretend not to understand, that racism is also just letting certain categories of people, usually darker and poorer – quietly slide into the “really not very important” zone of your moral consciousness. We see this right now as the genuinely heartbreaking stories of Israeli hostages are given prominence again and again over the equally or even more heartbreaking stories of Palestinians illegally detained for years in far greater numbers and for far longer, supposedly for the “crimes” of resisting occupation.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Self-defence? There are two points to make here:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Firstly, Israel is <em>not</em> in this instance entitled to “self-defence” – it’s not self-defence when you’re an already an occupying power, and the blockade of Gaza makes it a de facto occupier – an occupier that should under the rules of war be actively caring for the needs of the occupied and captive population.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Secondly, it seems the true meaning of “self-defence” has been utterly contaminated, in the public mind by the supposedly “pre-emptive” US-led <a href=\"https://lepage.wordpress.com/2002/11/18/a-briefing-against-war-on-iraq/\">invasions of Iraq</a> and Afghanistan, because there’s all too little questioning of Israel’s chosen mode of “self-defence”. But self-defence used to mean preparing to fend off a possible or visible imminent attack; not invading and obliterating a territory that contains possible future foes.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Reasonable self-defence in this instance might include rebuilding the barriers between Gaza and southern Israel, restoring and reinforcing the garrisons that were neglected, ensuring improved surveillance.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>But however confused the media/public may be, it’s clear the Western powers, Nato, Joe Biden – remain super-clear about the real nature of self-defence – they’ve shown this as, faced with a stronger power, they repeatedly sought to avoid assisting Ukraine with any attacks on Russia that enter its own territory; rather like people who poke a bear on their neighbour’s turf, then run away and leave the neighbours to deal with the consequences.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The Palestinians, being weak, are not afforded equivalent self-restraint: they don’t get the “excuse me, sir; I won’t trouble your nuclear arsenal” version of self-defence that the US/NATO affords Russia.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Israel’s actions are not self-defence. This is locking people up in a prison, and then bombing the prison, and it’s obscene. Israelis, like everyone, are entitled to peace and security – but not at any cost.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>There’s another whole layer, unfortunately, to Western hypocrisy here – because not only are they green-lighting genocidal levels of killing under the guise of “self-defence” but because their proposed “post-conflict” solution is to hand Gaza over to the administration of the Palestinian Authority – an entity that is undemocratic, corrupt, brutal and illegitimate.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:footnotes /--></p>",

The warm white downlighter LEDs I eventually found are really great, but it was very tricky finding fittings, as I didn't want to use downlighters everywhere. So I had to adapt 220 volt wall fittings for some of them; I’ve used them as downlighters in some instances, and some are hanging on wires from ceiling.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The aesthetics definitely still need attention – I need to hack lightshades now.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Many South Africans have resorted to using rechargeable lead-acid portable Magneto-branded lights – but I really, really wanted to get away from that horrid bleached-out cool white lighting that most of the Magneto lights have. The lighting quality of our backup system is now actually <em>better</em> in many instances than our warm white LED mains lighting.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Wiring has probably cost R1000 – low voltage wiring has to be quite heavy gauge. The cost of the wiring was probably one of the biggest surprises for me in this process – that cost could be reduced by shifting to a 24 volt system – but then where would one find 24 volt bulbs? Finding decent 12 volt bulbs in South Africa was hard enough, and involved endless calls and googling and testing (I started out buying just three bulbs and seeing if they worked as hoped for).</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>It took me ages and a lot of crawling around the attic to figure everything out and source components and install wiring, so took about three months to build in stages – I started with just two LEDs wired up to the battery – and I am still tweaking. I built most of the lighting before connecting up the panel, recharging the battery periodically with a R300 mains charger. But we’ve been fully operational with the solar panel for about six weeks now, and I’ve never since needed to top up with mains.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Of course, this setup isn’t powering any appliances – our cooking is still down to planning around loadshedding, filling a flask with hot water, and sometimes using a gas camping stove – but for up to stage 4/5 of loadshedding, we’re mostly fine. To ensure we don’t run out of battery power, I make sure I don’t turn everything on all at the same time, which is easy as we migrate from living spaces to bedrooms in the evenings; and in the mornings, we never need lights for more than two hours.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>It’s the kind of lighting system N. Americans put in their over-the-top vans – and still very modest by that standard! – stretched out over a house.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Our internet – fibre box and router – could run off this system, but that mostly works fine on an <a href=\"https://www.takealot.com/gizzu-8800mah-mini-ups-dual-dc/PLID71930088\">R800 lithium battery/micro-UPS</a> that we’ve had for two years now that typically lasts at least six hours before needing re-charging. But I do also use the 12 volt system to run an old wifi router repurposed as an Internet range extender that sits in the attic and gives us coverage in parts of the property we never had it before even during loadshedding.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:media-text {\"mediaId\":1021,\"mediaType\":\"image\"} --></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><figure class=\"wp-image-1021 size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/img_6268.jpeg\" alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/img_6268-xs.jpeg 640w ,https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/img_6268-sm.jpeg 768w ,https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/img_6268-md.jpeg 1024w ,https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/img_6268-lg.jpeg 1366w ,https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/img_6268-xl.jpeg 1600w ,https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/img_6268-2xl.jpeg 1920w\"></figure></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"placeholder\":\"Content…\"} --></p>\n<p>Repurposed router in the attic serving as range extender</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><!-- /wp:media-text --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I’m not a qualified electrician, but I've shown my setup to two visiting electricians and it seems I've got most things right enough. I do have overload protection on all the main loads (again, these are less than the power drawn by an old 60 watt incandescent bedside lamp), and a fuse on the solar panel circuit, and I’ve been pretty careful. I have had to teach myself <em>a lot</em> as the project advanced: my abundant childhood tinkering with soldering irons and batteries and twisted wire connections did not prepare me for this project.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>From what I’ve read in local forums and in the reviews of some of the products I bought on Takealot for this project, there are lots of people out there in SA who have similar systems for home – or camping! – but it’s still really not widely understood as an option. If you were to get an electrician to build it, it would probably take a day's work and labour costs accordingly. I'm pretty certain someone resourceful and with more time than I have could build a good business offering this kind of system on the market.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Besides my lack of knowledge (slowly accumulated via websites and YouTube), another thing that took time was that I just couldn’t get all the necessary components in one place: in the end, my battery and panel came from China Town in Ottery (bought in March in something of a panic over the prospect of grid blackout); LEDs and wire from Plumstead lighting, switches from Yebo Electronics, charge controller (returned two before I got a decent one) and micro-DB board and crimping tool and more wire from Takealot, crimp connectors from Kismet Hardware and Micra Hardware.<br><br>Postscript: It's often suggested – quite strongly suggested – that to avert the unpleasant effects of allowing the \"<a href=\"http://www.igbp.net/globalchange/greatacceleration.4.1b8ae20512db692f2a680001630.html\">great acceleration</a>\" to continue to the point of economic and ecological collapse, we need to moderate or even \"de-grow\" economies at some point. Working on this project has reminded me just how much most contemporary structures were built with the assumption that they could be lit, heated and cooled with abundant cheap fossil-derived energy – and how even at a domestic level, we can in fact \"de-grow\" without great sacrifice.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>",

I was 60 km south of Ventersdorp, a conscript in the then all-white South African Defence Force, at an artillery base five kilometres outside the Afrikaans university town of Potchefstroom: 4 Art, as it was known. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Ventersdorp, 100km west of Johannesburg, was then notorious as an AWB stronghold. The Battle of Ventersdorp was one of the most serious challenges from the white far-right to the authority of the National Party government, which by then had committed itself to some form of constitutional settlement with the ANC. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I’ve had to refresh my own memory. Wikipedia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ventersdorp\">describes it</a> thus:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The confrontation took place outside the Ventersdorp town hall where then State President F.W. de Klerk was scheduled to hold a public address. Ventersdorp was then a political stronghold of the right-wing Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), which had opposed de Klerk’s decision to recognise the African National Congress and release Nelson Mandela the previous year. The town was inundated by angry AWB supporters the day of de Klerk’s speech, including some carrying arms. The South African Police responded by setting up roadblocks and confiscating weapons... The AWB supporters numbered 2,000. They were armed with hunting rifles and pistols and wore protective items to shield them from the effects of an inevitable tear gas attack by the riot police. The police equalled the AWB in number, but were considerably better trained and equipped... Once the AWB cut the electricity and fired on the police, the police were ordered to shoot to kill. Three policemen were wounded, none of them fatally, while the police killed one AWB member. The AWB also fired into a police minibus. Two AWB members were killed and 13 were injured when the police returned fire from the minibus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Here’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/10/world/2-killed-as-apartheid-supporters-battle-police-at-de-klerk-speech.html\">another account, in the New York Times</a>.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>What neither of these accounts entirely captures, and what I know from my own experience, is just how determined the National Party was to defeat the challenge offered by the AWB. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>As the Ventersdorp confrontation loomed, the scale of the AWB threat became clear. It was by no means certain that the SAPS, the white-led apartheid police service, would be able to contain the AWB militia. So there was a back-up plan involving the army. A reserve force, entirely comprised of experienced officers and NCOs in (if my recollection is correct, around 30) armoured cars mounted with heavy machine guns – and I saw these being mounted – was marshalled on the outskirts of Ventersdorp, drawn from the various SADF units based in and around Potch, under the command of my “boss”, the artillery colonel. They were quite ready to swoop in if the police regulars were overwhelmed, and fight off the AWB; fortunately, the confrontation never became quite that bad.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>At the time, the SADF had a built-in divide between career officers and NCOs, who were called “permanent force”, and conscripted ordinary soldiers. Many of my fellow conscripts were open AWB supporters. (They were not always the crude racists that this affiliation would suggest, a subject for another day.) The career army officers were well aware of the affiliations of their troops. No doubt some of them shared these sympathies, but they were professionals, by and large loyal to the state. They did not risk including any conscripts in this reserve force. I was instructed to keep quiet about what I knew of these preparations. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Back to 2021, and here we have another nationalist South African government, now decades in power, faced with a dangerous threat to its authority:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>What do these inchoate insurrections have in common?

I shiver to think what invisible preparations are being made behind the scenes to counter it.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>These events differ in that the AWB threat came from the far-right of white South African politics, whereas the Zuma mob remains regrettably embedded all too closely within the ANC mainstream. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Perhaps this is for the best, in a weird sense. My bet, and I truly hope I am right, is that in the end, after much 11th-hour bluster, ANC leaders and elders will succeed in negotiating a peaceful surrender from the old crook. <br><br>(Postscript: They did.)</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} --></p>\n<h1>Some background</h1>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>How did I come to be a distant witness to the Battle of Ventersdorp?</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>At the time, military service was compulsory for young white men in South Africa. The devil's bargain of the apartheid state was turning its children (the human brain doesn't <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=141164708\">fully mature until age 25</a>) towards violence and moral compromise. This was of course dressed up as heroic service against the many enemies of the state.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Many young white men of my age and class managed to defer compulsory military service by extending their university studies. That wasn’t an option for me. Following a bout of (undiagnosed, untreated) severe depression, I’d had been forced to drop out of my BA Hons. degree in English literature midway through 1990, and my choices were either to leave SA, go to prison as a conscientious objector (I considered this, but did not have the courage for a likely minimum two years in jail), or go to the army for one year. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>By then, fortunately, the white South African military had withdrawn from its Cold War battles in Angola and Namibia. We were now not the \"boys on the border\". As a conscript, I no longer risked being forced to fight against Cubans in Angola or to brutalise SWAPO insurgents in Namibia. The term for conscription had been cut from two years as was the norm during the 1980s to one year only. But conscripts were still pushed into the dirty work of the apartheid state, supporting “police action” in the South African townships, then frequently the site of running battles between the SAPS, ANC supporters, and members of the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party, who frequently operated as police surrogates. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I was fortunate. I am nearly blind in my left eye, and so, after being “called up”, got a medical exemption from ever having to fire a gun. I hadn’t anticipated that. But I’d been a practising Buddhist for about two years then, and had become a UDF supporter during my time at the University of Cape Town, so I had no complaints about being non-combatant. The UDF (United Democratic Front) was the 1980s alliance of union and civil society organisations that represented the ANC inside South Africa before its unbanning; and included in its ranks people like our current president, Cyril Ramaphosa.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>After my six weeks basic training, I was assigned as a clerk in the office of the brigade Colonel, for whom I was running errands on 9 August 1991, an unlikely witness to the preparation of this counter-insurgency operation; at once shocked and impressed by the determination of the National Party to face down a facist threat to its own authority.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>My role as a clerk made me privy to a register of firearm and armaments accidents that resulted from conscripts stealing and taking home weapons, and it was a long and horrifying list. <br><br>I also remember meeting many prisoners of the military police, some of whom, after repeated periods of going AWOL, had circulated between time in the ranks, civilian prison and military prison for up to eight years, trapped in a military-bureaucratic-penitential purgatory. The military liked to claim that it would make a man of you, and some did thrive and mature, after a fashion, but many others were just broken.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Here's some further reading: <br><br><em>Theresa Edlmann, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-lingering-unspoken-pain-of-white-youth-who-fought-for-apartheid-46218\">The Conversation, 2 September 2015</a>, 'The lingering, unspoken pain of white youth who fought for apartheid'.</em><br><br>I don't class myself as bearing the pain described by Edlmann. I was slightly older, and by virtue of my initial university education and experiences of student and progressive politics, morally more fully formed when I was conscripted than were most of my fellow troops. (I still remember the horsing around that ensued when we were issued with rifles; I was horrified both that my companions were playing with real weapons, and that the officers did not check this behaviour. We really were children.) I was never, thankfully, forced into combat or directly morally compromising actions.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In noting the real pain and damage the apartheid state inflicted on its beneficiaries (undue privilege always has a price), I in no way mean to minimise or draw equivalences with the compounding horrors and indignities visited on black South Africans during, before and after that era, which have been consigned all too quickly to wilful forgetfulness. Most white South Africans do not fully understand and recognise the extent of the collective crimes of the apartheid and colonial states in South Africa.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Another impression from those experiences that lives on: the SADF defined itself by its mission to \"fight communism\". Yet there can be few better examples of the kind of command economy espoused by state-led communism than the internal economy of an army. The irony was overwhelming: you had to become your enemy to fight them.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The army I was part of had lost its sense of purpose. It was still fighting old wars; we sang marching songs about enemies with whom the politicians had already made peace. Waste and abuse of resources was endemic; resources were \"free\" and entirely taken for granted by most. <br><br>Some countries, notably Costa Rica, have abandoned having a military altogether; and the decision has only helped along their development. Yet how do you defend yourself in a world with other real armies – the need to do so is real. Another subject for another occasion.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>",

(Guarded yay... )</p>\n<p>But it also seems that even amongst the very well-intended there's still an absolute s**tload of de facto denial about the extent of the problem and what it's going to take to undo it.</p>\n<p>You care about climate change, you say. You marched behind your children today. (Well, I hope you did.) So why are you still invested in Sasol?</p>\n<p>I'm STILL seeing (lots of) people concentrating their focus on personal solutions. \"Get on a bike, install LED light bulbs and solar power, drive and fly less\" – all these things can be good – and they're all staggeringly inadequate given that we have to HALVE GLOBAL EMISSIONS IN THE NEXT ELEVEN YEARS if we are to avoid [no, not the end of the world for everyone, but, yes, the end of the world for those whose lives will be destroyed by ever more vicious cyclones and hurricanes in the next decade, total destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, tripling the portion of the world's population exposed to heat extremes, doubling extinction rates, and bringing us ever closer to passing tipping points in natural systems that could accelerate climate breakdown even when we stop emitting carbon].</p>\n<p>People, we are up against corporations like Sasol that have missed every carbon emissions reduction target they have ever set themselves, and you're still investing in them.</p>\n<p>The Arctic and Amazon are burning, and you're still investing in Sasol (and Billiton, and Exxaro, and Anglo).</p>\n<p>We're up against global fossil fuel corporations that spend more money marketing their pitifully small \"green\" investments in wind and solar energy than on the investments themselves, companies like Shell that have corrupted whole governments in the service of their ruthless extractivism.</p>\n<p>We are up against ANC politicians who still seriously believe there is such a thing as clean coal. I met one in Parliament last week.</p>\n<p>We are up against fellow citizens who 20 years after Google was invented still do not bother to check their profoundly misguided assumptions about how we still need coal for \"baseload\". (New wind and solar power are now HALF the cost of new coal power in South Africa. Chile cut its electricity prices by 75% in JUST FOUR YEARS by investing substantially in wind and solar energy.) You still love a growly car so much that you're prepared to leave your household budget hostage to deadly US-Saudi-Iranian geopolitical shenanigans?</p>\n<p>Every item of worthy personal, individual change (Meatless Mondays, cycling more, etc) is, IF NOT COMBINED WITH SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ACTION, a half-assed act of self-delusion that is staggeringly inadequate when measured up against the scale of the problems.</p>\n<p>Our SA government has supposedly signed up for the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees – but three years after signing, our ACTUAL EMISSIONS STILL HAVE US HEADED FOR FOUR DEGREES.</p>\n<p>You care about climate change, you say. Again, why are you still invested in Sasol?</p>\n<p>Our business media is so terrible that MoneyWeb and Classic Business refuse to cover the fossil fuel divestment movement, even as total global assets under management committed to some form of decarbonisation pass 16% of total global equities.</p>\n<p>In our so-called democracy, where we STILL don't know who the hell funds the ANC or the DA or the EFF, we do know that in 2019 – 2019! – none of them has anything resembling a serious climate change policy; and that the Minister of Mineral and Energy Resources sounds more like a coal industry PR shill than someone who has sworn an oath to uphold a Constitution that promises a safe and secure environment; and that our ostensibly reformist president wants to help the Chinese build yet another absolutely massive coal-powered plant in Limpopo that will completely f**k our national carbon budgets and already teetering water security.</p>\n<p>We have a National Treasury that in 2019 can release an economic policy document that (despite many good points) still does not integrate the simple fact that the most fundamental pillar of any economy is the environment, and that South Africa has one of the most degraded environments in the world, but apparently seriously expects this self-cannibalised rust bucket of an economy to be able to accelerate just by putting coal-powered pedal to the metal yet again, without making environmental recovery an over-arching imperative.</p>\n<p>These are some of the SYSTEM CHANGES you should be fighting for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demand that your government and political party has a plan for transitioning the economy to 50% cuts of current emissions by 2030 and 100% by 2040 (the UN says 2050, but we need to be even more ambitious).</li>\n<li>Demand that your political party discloses its funding and pledges to take no money from the fossil fuel industry.</li>\n<li>Demand that your asset manager or retirement fund has a plan to decarbonise your portfolio over five years at most (all the evidence is that your returns will only be enhanced, not that Allan Gray or Coronation has bothered to tell you this).</li>\n<li>Meet your MP. Supposedly we have all have access to a constituency MP in this country. The arrangement's a bit of a joke really, given MPs answer to our gangster parties, not us, but still: demand to meet your MP, demand their party disclose its funding, demand a serious climate policy, demand a Green New Deal for SA.</li>\n<li>Demand that we have an electoral system that is not just proportional representation but also has a large constituency element so that you can vote out your local MP if they turn out to be a coal industry shill.</li>\n<li>Picket the offices of our awful, gobsmackingly blinkered and ignorant news media and besiege the inboxes of their public editors. Today, millions of children around the world marched for the climate – and the headlines on News24 are the Rugby World Cup and, literally, I kid you not, \"How to braai the perfect steak\". The editors should be shot, or at the very least, exiled to Beira. The Daily Maverick's headline is (as usual) something about \"Juju\". (Even while publishing its excellent Burning Planet series and noisily proclaiming its dedication to truth, the DM still publishes occasional climate obfuscation without rudimentary fact checking, and has refused to entertain the suggestion that publishing daily climate statistics might be of more lasting consequence than the R/$ exchange rate.) Nothing on Business Day about the climate marches, IOL is talking about some poor woman's sinus infection, EWN is much more excited about a youth choir. If an asteroid is ever headed for Earth, astronomers will have to name it after a Kardashian for the farcically incompetent SA media to even think about alerting us.</li>\n<li>Become seriously intolerant of our world-beating inequality. Inequality cripples democracy, and crippled democracies cripple climate action. We need a Green New Deal for South Africa that simultaneously attacks our problems of mass poverty, inequality and degraded environments; and you need to be not just willing but gagging to pay higher taxes to fund it if necessary, because when global catastrophe threatens, it may be time to happily give up the big 4x4, the second home and the annual holidays abroad.</li>\n<li>Demand that our government starts paying women for just being women, because just being a woman is costly; and fully empowering women is essential to fixing the climate.</li>\n<li>Don't think technology alone will save us. Wind and solar energy have huge potential to ween us from fossil fuels, but without political and social solutions, they'll never reach that potential; and creating eco-friendly agriculture, the other 20% of climate breakdown, requires deep CULTURAL change.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And for pity's sakes, stop whining about how people are the problem and how we need to \"save the planet\". The real, itchy, uncomfortable truth is that rich people are the problem – 20% of the world's population is responsible for 80% of the emissions. The planet is – yes, really – a living organism currently running a very nasty fever called industrial civilisation, but it will recover with or without us (hopefully with); and if you're weeping for the whales and the animals and wildlife, please weep as much for people, because in this era, only looking after people properly ensures that other species get the chances they deserve.</p>\n<p>The truth about people is that when treated with dignity and freed from the multiple layers of exploitation in which they have all too often been embedded by early 21st century \"civilisation\", they, we, almost always become the progenitors of solutions. The problems we have created for ourselves demand that we create a TOTALLY DIFFERENT KIND OF GLOBAL ECONOMY WITHIN ONE GENERATION, A RESTORATIVE/REGENERATIVE/INCLUSIVE ECONOMY; and we have to start seeing our current massive global population not as the problem, but as a global massed choir (not an army) of potentially individually creative spirits who can, who must, start working together to rebuild Mother Earth's tattered life support systems.</p>",

And that means — among other things — not investing in corporations that contribute to global heating.</h2>\n<p title=\"Click to expand\"><i aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>NGOs for education need to ask whether they are betraying their beneficiaries by accepting funds that come in part from companies that are systematically destroying the world in which young people will have to live, says the author. (Image source: Matt Howard/Unsplash) <a><i></i>Less </a></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Every South African NGO, union or foundation either has invested or endowed funds or receives funding from donors that have invested funds. Which means that every single SA NGO and foundation can greatly multiply its impact by ensuring that its funds are responsibly invested, or by asking its funders to re-examine their own investments.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Our financial systems evolved in an entirely different era. They are now extremely ill-fitted to the raft of systemic challenges facing global society. Climate and ecological breakdown, multiplying already grotesque inequality, are, as the World Economic Forum has identified, the greatest and most likely risks facing global society.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">NGOs that do not recognise how their finances are linked to environmental and social destruction might as well close up shop — as the sources of their income are too often creating and compounding the very problems they aim to solve.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Let’s consider some examples.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">NGOs that are fighting for gender equality and for the rights of people living with HIV/Aids may remember the continuing impact of extractivism and mining on the social and political fabric of South Africa. We are both one of the world’s most historically resource-intensive economies and living with a gender-rights crisis, in good part because of the social havoc wrought by these industries.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">So gender justice advocates shouldn’t take money from unreformed mining companies.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">NGOs for education need to ask whether they are betraying their beneficiaries by accepting funds that come in part from companies that are systematically destroying the world in which young people will have to live.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">NGOs fighting corruption should be clear on the huge role that SA fossil fuel (coal, gas and oil) corporations play in fostering corruption. It’s no coincidence that the likes of the Guptas gravitate towards the brutal and unscrupulous coal industry.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">The most fundamental infrastructure for any economy is a stable climate, clean air, clean water, and healthy well-fed, well-educated people in safe communities. But many of the industries and companies that are supposedly the backbone of our economy systematically undermine this basic infrastructure.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Eskom and Sasol and other coal-intensive companies, for example, are engaged in mass human rights violations, aided and abetted by government and an asset management industry blinkered by short-term incentives.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Consider, for example, Sasol, in which most investing South Africans have shares. For annual revenues of about R25-billion, Sasol is willing to impose climate damages on society that, conservatively calculated, start at R45-billion — every year. Every Sasol shareholder who does not challenge this status quo effectively winks to an open scandal. The damage calculation <i>excludes</i> non-climate externalities. The government effectively declines to hold Sasol to account (while officials pocket dividends via their pensions: The Public Investment Corporation and Allan Gray are Sasol’s two biggest shareholders).</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Climate change has already cost the economy 10% of GDP. Air pollution costs the equivalent of 6% of GDP annually. Corruption and crime cost at least 1.5% and 19% of GDP. All are deeply linked to what has been called extractivism. Our economy is not built on mining; it is stunted by mining. Yet our leaders insist again and again that economic value must be dug out of the ground. It’s a model that serves only elites.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">When our union movement resists the renewable energy transition, it is selling its members in the fossil fuel industrial complex short by effectively insisting they can never do better than to hold dangerous, dirty, underpaid jobs that threaten their health and make them complicit in the often corrupt operations of their paymasters.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">It’s no coincidence that the concept of ethical investment is practically unknown in South Africa. But it shouldn’t be — the global disinvestment campaign against companies doing business in apartheid South Africa helped dislodge our racist former government.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Few South Africans seem to know that we are far more vulnerable to the climate crisis than many developed countries. The UK has warmed just 1°C — and the UK Parliament has already, even amid Brexit paralysis, declared a climate emergency. South Africa has warmed 2°C, faces six degrees of warming in the interior in the next few decades — and our politicians are still celebrating oil, gas and coal as if the climate crisis didn’t exist.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">If our media worked better and our politicians were less parochial, you would know that the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessed in 2018 that avoiding the worst climate breakdown demands cutting global carbon emissions by 50% — in just the next 12 years.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">It’s a report that should have become an instant national conversation. It didn’t, so you need to talk about it at your next board meeting.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Divestment is a rapidly growing global movement to move capital out of the unstable, extractive, fossil-fuel economy that threatens us with climate breakdown into the regenerative economy: A potential new era of social and economic stability based on wind and solar energy, a circular economy, sustainable agriculture and large-scale ecological restoration.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Globally, hundreds of foundations, universities, pension funds, cities such as New York and London, even a whole country, Ireland, have opted to divest. They know this transformation depends on capital owners who will no longer tolerate the socially destructive behaviour of companies such as Sasol.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Many foundations, philanthropies, churches, schools and universities in South Africa have endowed funds and investments. You need to start demanding that these investments be managed responsibly, particularly with respect to climate and inequality. Investors must partially divest from irresponsible companies, engage robustly on all material environmental, social and governance issues and set timelines for further divestment where necessary.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Investors can move faster than governments and catalyse the urgent transition to renewable, universally accessible energy by shifting capital out of the problems and into the solutions today.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Apologists for fossil fuels insist they are still vital for economic development. This is tantamount to selling you a <i>skedonk</i> for a fortune and not telling you that you could go round the corner to buy a Ferrari at the same price because many of our developmental deadlocks could, in fact, be unlocked with a sincere effort to reform our economy.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">This is the visionary “Green New Deal” that is now being discussed in the US and Europe: essentially, creating a new era of high-quality employment and social well-being on the back of retooling our manufactured and environmental infrastructure to resolve social and ecological stresses.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">South African CSOs need to stop investing in ways that undermine their own missions. As Fossil Free SA, we advocate for divestment. But limited or staged divestment can work hand-in-hand with dialogue and constructive shareholder engagement. The key thing is for all investors to move from passive acceptance to active intolerance of corporate abuses (on all issues, not just climate). Divestment helped end slavery and apartheid, and it can help make our society future-fit.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">If you are a leader within any kind of organisation, start this conversation now with your colleagues and peers. It’s time your funding worked as hard for your beneficiaries as you do.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">There’s little to fear. Fossil Free SA, for example, is part-funded by a foundation that divested from fossil fuels years ago and has seen its returns greatly enhanced.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Later this year, this conversation will be much advanced in South Africa by the international conference, <a href=\"https://financingthefuture.global/\">Financing the Future: The Global Climate Divest-Invest Summit</a>, from 10–11 September 2019 in Cape Town.  It will help with tools and resources to align capital with climate goals and challenge the global community to leave fossil fuels in the ground. It will outline how environmentally sound development benefits communities in multiple dimensions — and point to the many opportunities created when we align our investments with our values. <u><strong>DM</strong></u></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><em>David Le Page is co-ordinator of Fossil Free SA, and is one of the convenors of the international conference, <a href=\"https://financingthefuture.global/\">Financing the Future: The Global Climate Divest-Invest Summit</a>, from 10–11 September 2019 in Cape Town.</em></p>",

The causality of such events is always complex.</p>\n<p>But an increase in extreme weather events like these are very much what has been predicted by scientists studying climate change. Climate change \"loads the dice\" in favour of such events, which in Knysna caused seven deaths, left 4,000 people homeless and forced the evacuation of another 10,000.</p>\n<p>Human-induced climate change is largely caused by the global warming effect of carbon dioxide emissions, most of which come from burning oil, gas and coal: fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>SA is more vulnerable to climate change than many countries, with its average temperatures having increased by at least 1.5 times more than the observed global average (0.65°C) over the past 50 years. In the face of this emergency, you would think SA would be taking a leadership role in combating climate change. But it does not.</p>\n<p>The Climate Action Tracker groups countries into four categories according to the gaps between stated collective commitments to the ambition established at the Paris climate talks — to hold average global warming \"well below\" 2°C — and their actual individual commitments.</p>\n<p>SA’s nationally determined contribution is in the lowest category: inadequate. If the whole world behaves as poorly as SA, the global temperature increase will exceed 4°C in this century and global civilisation will, by most scientific assessments, most likely end, crushed by multiple stresses — drought, heat stress, extreme weather, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss — on infrastructure, food production and human health.</p>\n<p>Economists gloss over this terrifying scenario with the dry language of massive \"damage to GDP\", but that doesn’t capture what Robert Pindyck of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology describes as \"the possibility of a catastrophic climate outcome\".</p>\n<p>Most people in SA believe that because they do not live close to sea level or are desert-bound nomads, they will be immune to the worst effects of climate change. They may be, for a while, if they can close their ears to the cries of people outside the gates as they pile their children into an oversized 4x4.</p>\n<p>Being a developing country is no excuse for SA’s lack of ambition. As Eskom makes itself an abuser by holding the renewable energy programme hostage, 48 developing countries have committed to 100% renewable targets; and all those with climate commitments ranked as \"sufficient\" are developing countries.</p>\n<p>China, India and Brazil are far more ambitious than SA, where people persist in the delusion that fossil fuels are needed for development. There are relatively few stable jobs in the coal industry, many are dirty and dangerous, and a small levy on renewable energy could ease a \"just transition\". Using fossil fuels for development is rather like burning down the house to stay warm. Their promotion in government policy is now a matter of state capture, not the rational pursuit of the best interests of all the people.</p>\n<p>Eskom should be dedicated to getting low-cost clean energy to all, but it is now run as a source of subsidy for greedy coal interests at great direct and indirect cost to citizens. UK consumer energy prices are falling as fossil fuels are phased out; SA’s continue to mount.</p>\n<p>Most of SA’s contribution to escalating climate change comes from Eskom, Sasol, and the rest of the coal industry: companies such as Anglo Coal, Exxaro, BHP Billiton and Xstrata, cynically funded by big banks that purport to be concerned over climate change. Globally, companies such as Shell, BP and Exxon Mobil still work to block the development of cleaner energy. Even economics textbooks now state proper climate policies are blocked by the natural resource industries.</p>\n<p>For a secure future, people should stop investing in these companies, and invest where possible in cleaner energy.</p>\n<p>Critics argue that divestment transfers ownership to less scrupulous investors, but it also helps to avert fossil fuel energy development, raise the cost of capital and end social consent to the fossil fuel corporate sector.</p>\n<p>Around the world, hundreds of institutions now worth more than $5-trillion, led by universities but including cities such as Paris, Melbourne, Oslo and Copenhagen and a country, Ireland – are stopping their investments in fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>In May, Fossil Free SA convened a workshop for financial services professionals in Cape Town on divestment, part sponsored by Futuregrowth Asset Management. It was aimed at building understanding of climate and carbon risk — and the divest-reinvest movement – among financial services professionals and to catalyse the creation of divested funds and instruments (jury still out). Representatives of 15 financial services companies attended.</p>\n<p>Tracey Davies of the Centre for Environmental Rights spoke on the implications of the landmark high court finding that the minister of environmental affairs should have considered the climate change effects of the proposed Thabametsi power station before authorising it.</p>\n<p>Paul Chandler of the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment outlined the proposals of the G-20-appointed task force on climate-related financial disclosure, which produced recommendations that all significant corporate emitters should be reporting on their exposure to climate and carbon risk.</p>\n<p>There are few reasons to fear that divested funds will lose value. During the divestment workshop, Sam Gill of ET Index Research in London described how to \"cut carbon, beat the market\". ETI’s analysis shows that a JSE SWIX index-based portfolio would have performed substantially better over the past four years if strongly divested.</p>\n<p>Some argue that this was a transitory arbitrage opportunity, but there are good reasons to doubt the future of fossil-fuel companies. The share of the sector in the S&amp;P500, for example, has declined from 25% to 6.9% since 1980. Globally, according to MSCI research, investors would have been better off without fossil fuels in their portfolios since 2007.</p>\n<p>SA’s philanthropists, too, should give serious thought to how they invest: there’s little point in funding education or health when it is done with investments that effectively steal from the future in which our children must live and work.</p>\n<p>South African philanthropies probably command endowments well in excess of R15bn, according to research by GastrowBloch Philanthropies. Yet they have, with the exception of the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation, made little progress towards aligning investments with values.</p>\n<p>There’s more to the evils — and immense costs — of fossil fuels than climate change. But besides resource wars and economic instability, University of Cape Town research indicates that more than 27,000 South Africans are killed yearly by air pollution every year. And the industry is extremely corrupt: in SA, deeply linked to those overseeing a \"silent coup\".</p>\n<p>The academic authors of the Betrayal of the Promise report argue that \"Eskom and Transnet, in turn, are the primary vehicles for managing state capture, large-scale looting of state resources and … a continuous source of self-enrichment and funding for the power elite and their patronage network\".</p>\n<p>No one who loves SA should be invested in fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>Fund managers say there is not yet any visible local demand for divested funds and this is true. But divestment is the right thing to do and, given the accelerating renewable energy revolution and regulation of greenhouse gases, the smart thing to do. Sing it to the heavens, before they overheat.</p>\n<p>It’s time to tell your financial services provider and company pension fund trustees you no longer want to be invested in destroying your future.</p>\n<p>• Le Page is the co-ordinator of Fossil Free SA.</p>\n</div>",

Divestment helped make SA a democracy. Fossil fuel companies are becoming highly sensitive to divestment pressure.</li>\n<li>UCT is a leading centre of learning in South Africa and Africa and has already made strong commitments to sustainability and to addressing poverty and inequality.</li>\n<li>It is morally wrong to be invested in fossil fuels.

Will UCT be a laggard?</li>\n<li>Globally, support for divestment is growing fast.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Humanity has set a 2 °C target for limiting global warming – but even 2 °C would bring severe impacts for Africa</h3>\n<p>All the world’s governments have agreed, in international climate change negotiations, that global warming should be kept below two degrees. But representatives of developing countries, which are more vulnerable than most developed countries, have called for <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">even</span> lower targets.</p>\n<p>At the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations in Copenhagen in 2009, Sudanese diplomat Lumumba Di-Aping, then lead negotiator for the G77 bloc, which included most developing countries, referred to the two-degree target as ‘a suicide pact’. ‘2 °C is certain death for Africa,’ he said, referring to the IPCC’s AR4 report, and arguing that the 2 °C target had ‘no basis in science’.</p>\n<p>He is not alone. Others agree that humanity’s target for limiting warming should be lower – no more than 1.5 °C:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Following the brutal Typhoon Haiyan, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) stated: ‘Science has confirmed that unless we begin to reduce emissions immediately, the opportunity to keep global warming below the critical 1.5 °C threshold could be irrevocably lost.’</li>\n<li>‘Our objective is to save [all of] humanity and not just half of humanity. We are here to save Mother Earth. Our objective is to reduce climate change to under 1°C. [Above this,] many islands will disappear, and Africa will suffer a holocaust,’ said Bolivian president Evo Morales in Copenhagen in 2009 at the COP 15 UN climate summit.</li>\n<li>The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has said that international agreement ‘to limit temperature increases to a maximum of 1.5 degrees is essential’.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref\"><sup>[2]</sup></a></li>\n<li>‘Two degrees is not enough – we should be thinking of 1.5 °C. If we are not headed to 1.5 °C we are in big, big trouble,’ said Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UNFCCC in June 2011.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The 2 °C limit, expected to be roughly consistent with keeping atmospheric carbon dioxide below 450 parts per million (ppm), is a politically agreed target. Many climate scientists are not sanguine about a 450 ppm world. ‘We should not use [2 °C] as a target,’ said renowned Columbia University climatologist James Hansen in 2013. ‘It doesn’t have any scientific basis.’</p>\n<p>Elsewhere he has written, ‘If humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO<sub>2</sub> will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm.’<sup><a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Nicholas Stern, former World Bank chief economist and lead author of the landmark Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, has said: ‘It is most important to stop the increase of flows of emissions short term and then start the decline of flows of annual emissions and get them down to levels which will move concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> back down towards 350 ppm.’</p>\n<h3>Governments have not yet taken actions consistent with their declared targets, and we are headed for global warming of far more than 2 °C</h3>\n<p>Despite having signed up for the 2 °C target,<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> with all its limitations, governments have not yet taken all the steps needed to regulate carbon emissions and prevent them from exceeding humanity’s collective carbon budget.</p>\n<p>Certainly governments pay lip service to the need for cutting carbon. ‘We need government, businesses and society to choose low-carbon paths and to make those choices now,’ said South Africa’s minister in the presidency, Jeff Radebe, recently.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> But when assessed in terms of their actions, not their words (arguably the only proper way to assess politicians), politicians are failing us.</p>\n<p>The result of this inaction is that the world is currently on course for potentially disastrous levels of climate change – an overall trend that will be even more painful for Africa.</p>\n<p>‘Policies that have been implemented, or are now being pursued, suggest that the long-term average temperature increase is more likely to be between 3.6 °C and 5.3 °C (compared with pre-industrial levels), with most of the increase occurring this century,’ says the International Energy Agency.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref\"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>\n<h3>The likely consequences of our current climate trajectory are dire</h3>\n<p>In 2007, Stern set out to calculate the economic costs of climate change for the UK government, producing his landmark Stern Review:</p>\n<blockquote>... the Review estimates that if we don’t act, the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global GDP each year, now and forever. If a wider range of risks and impacts is taken into account, the estimates of damage could rise to 20% of GDP or more. In contrast, the costs of action – reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change – can be limited to around 1% of global GDP each year.<sup><a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref\">[7]</a></sup></blockquote>\n<p>Losing 20% of GDP sounds dramatic enough. But Stern has since reconsidered his original estimates:</p>\n<blockquote> Looking back, I underestimated the risks. The planet and the atmosphere seem to be absorbing less carbon than we expected, and emissions are rising pretty strongly. Some of the effects are coming through more quickly than we thought then.</blockquote>\n<p>What is the ultimate destination of our current carbon emissions trajectory? Potentially it is a global environment that can no longer support stable economies and societies. There is a strong chance that civilisation as we know it will end within the next couple of centuries, if not sooner. This is the scenario euphemistically referred to by scientists as ‘beyond adaptation’. This means that while it is already inevitable that we will have to adapt to a certain amount of climate change, if we fail to cut our emissions dramatically there will come a point at which multiple impacts on infrastructure, health, food security and economies will pile up beyond our collective ability to adapt. As Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research in the UK explains:</p>\n<p>There is a widespread view that a 4 °C future is incompatible with an organised global community, is likely to be beyond adaptation, is devastating to the majority of ecosystems and has a high probability of not being stable (in other words, 4 °C would be an interim temperature on the way to a much higher equilibrium level).</p>\n<h3>Our current carbon emissions trajectory will lead to catastrophe for Africa</h3>\n<p>What will be the consequences of 3.6 °C and 5.3 °C climate change for Africa, if Di-Aping is correct in calling even 2 °C a ‘death sentence’?</p>\n<p>The World Bank tells us that if the world warms by just 2 °C, a point that may be reached in 20 to 30 years’ time, we should expect widespread food shortages, unprecedented heatwaves, and more intense cyclones in Sub-Saharan Africa. Weather extremes will batter the continent’s growing informal settlements, harming the lives of people who have had little hand in raising the Earth’s temperature. We lose a possible 40% of our current maizelands. Water availability drops by 20%. The proportion of the population that is undernourished could increase by anything from 25% to 90%.</p>\n<p>If we go beyond two degrees of global warming, the consequences will be devastating, particularly for Africa and its poor. A UNEP report concludes: ‘Africa’s survival is at risk: No continent will be struck as severely by the impacts of climate change as Africa. Given its geographical position, the continent will be particularly vulnerable due to the considerably limited adaptive capacity, exacerbated by widespread poverty and the existing low levels of development.’<sup><a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n<p>For a taste of what might be in store for parts of Africa, let us consider the example of Syria. A severe drought from 2006–2010 turned 60% of Syria’s fertile land into desert. By 2010, this drought had killed 80% of the country’s cattle.</p>\n<p>Was this drought the result of human-induced climate change? Almost certainly. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/10/27/355639/noaa-climate-change-mediterranean-droughts/\">concluded in 2011</a> that ‘human-caused climate change [is now] a major factor in more frequent Mediterranean droughts’.</p>\n<p>The result of this drought, combined of course with regional instability, has been to make Syrian the most violent country on Earth<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> – as predicted by members of the Syrian government. A 2008 cable from the US Embassy in Damascus to the State Department, published by Wikileaks, details warnings from Syria’s UN food and agriculture representative, Abdullah bin Yehia: ‘Yehia told us that the Syrian minister of agriculture … stated publicly that economic and social fallout from the drought was “beyond our capacity as a country to deal with.”’<sup><a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref\">[10]</a></sup></p>\n<p>In other words, both the Syrian and US governments knew that Syria was on the verge of climate-related breakdown three years before the actual collapse – yet were unable to avert it.</p>\n<p>This bodes ill for Africa, a continent that is on average even less developed than was Syria. Climate change was a key driver of the conflict in Darfur, with the UN Environment programme concluding that: ‘Darfur ... holds grim lessons for other countries at risk.’<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref\">[11]</a></p>\n<p>Already, of the estimated 300,000 deaths caused each year by climate change, over 80% are of African and South Asian children.</p>\n<h3>If fossil fuel companies burn all their reserves, as they plan to, we will far overshoot the 2 °C target</h3>\n<p>In a rational world, governments would have already taken the actions required to keep us below the 2 °C target, at the least, if not the 1.5 °C target actually required by science.</p>\n<p>But the current trend is that overall emissions are continuing to grow at an alarming pace, such that we will hit our emissions ‘cap’ in just 15 years’ time.</p>\n<p>According to Corinne Le Quéré of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in the UK, global emissions remain within the highest scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>\n<p>‘This is a 5 °C trajectory. It’s absolutely tragic for humanity to be on this pathway,’ Le Quéré said in November 2013.<sup><a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref\">[12]</a></sup></p>\n<p>This situation has now been expressed in terms of ‘carbon budgets’. To reduce the chance of exceeding 2°C warming to 20%, as the world’s government have agreed to do, humanity cannot afford to allow its collective emissions up to 2050 to exceed 886 GtCO<sub>2</sub>. But, according to 2011 calculations, emissions from the first decade of this century already leave a budget of just 565 GtCO<sub>2</sub> for the remaining years to 2050. Meanwhile, the total carbon potential of the Earth’s known fossil fuel reserves comes to 2795 GtCO<sub>2</sub>. (65% of this is from coal, while oil provides 22% and gas 13%.)<a href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref\">[13]</a></p>\n<p>In other words, if the world’s fossil fuel companies follow their business plans and burn all their reserves, there is no chance of preserving a human-friendly climate.</p>\n<h3>Fossil fuel companies are not just wrecking the climate, but also hacking democracy and science, and slowing the development of renewable energy.</h3>\n<p>One would think that companies with a business plan based on what science shows to be massive indirect genocide would by now be social pariahs, their activities outlawed by governments around the world. This has not happened, however, because fossil fuel companies have corrupted many governments around the world by direct and indirect means. It is a widespread failure of good governance that has forced the creation of the movement for fossil fuel divestment.</p>\n<p>‘We’ve had nearly a century of universal suffrage now, and what happens is capital finds ways to protect itself from, you know, the voters,’ writes conservative UK commentator Robert Staines.<a href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref\"><sup>[14]</sup></a> The BBC’s economics editor, Robert Peston, has observed: ‘To put it another way, the voices of the super-wealthy are heard by politicians well above the babble of the crowd... It means that we are more vulnerable than perhaps we have been since the nineteenth century to the advent of rule by an unelected oligarchy.’<sup><a href=\"#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref\">[15]</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the case of Shell, Wikileaks revealed that the company had gone as far as infiltrating the Nigerian government to ensure it had access to all political decisions relating to its business.<sup><a href=\"#_ftn16\" name=\"_ftnref\">[16]</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the West, this influence is blatant. No less than four of the ministers in the current British government have links to Shell, while a third are linked to the broader fossil fuel industry.<sup><a href=\"#_ftn17\" name=\"_ftnref\">[17]</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the US, the fossil fuel lobby was spending $440,000 a day<a href=\"#_ftn18\" name=\"_ftnref\"><sup>[18]</sup></a> on lobbying Congress in 2012. Congress is arguably the single most concentrated point of political resistance to climate change action on the planet, but has been described by <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> columnist Thomas Friedman as ‘a forum for legalised bribery’.<a href=\"#_ftn19\" name=\"_ftnref\">[19]</a> Quite apart from that vast and clearly visible stream of money from fossil fuel companies to climate change-denying politicians, research shows that US democracy has been hollowed out:</p>\n<blockquote>Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on US government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence.<sup><a href=\"#_ftn20\" name=\"_ftnref\">[20]</a></sup></blockquote>\n<p>In South Africa, we are ignorant of the full extent of the influence of fossil fuel companies on our politicians – because there is no transparency or regulation of private funding to political parties and politicians in South Africa, and most of our parties have strongly resisted transparency.<a href=\"#_ftn21\" name=\"_ftnref\"><sup>[21]</sup></a> However, the slow response of Eskom to climate change and its sharply increasing subsidy to emerging coal interests are strongly suggestive of political influence overwhelmingly favouring coal over renewables.</p>\n<p>In short, the reality for all too many modern nation states is that they face a global economic order in which reckless corporate power is in the ascendant, threatening the livelihoods of the poor and middle classes with no respect for borders, and against which most politicians cannot or will not deploy their full authority.<sup><a href=\"#_ftn22\" name=\"_ftnref\">[22]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The full extent of this influence is demonstrated not only by the failure to properly regulate carbon emissions, but by the extent of the subsidies still given to fossil fuels, vastly larger than those given to the emerging cleaner technologies that are so urgently needed. Worldwide subsidies for fossil fuel consumption amounted by one estimate to an estimated $523 bn in 2011, an increase of 27% over 2010. The International Monetary Fund estimates that on a ‘post-tax basis’, [factoring in negative externalities] total subsidies are much higher, at $1.9 trillion. Meanwhile, global subsidies and financial support for renewable energy (excluding large hydropower) in 2011 totalled just $88bn, one sixth of fossil fuel subsidies.<sup><a href=\"#_ftn23\" name=\"_ftnref\">[23]</a></sup></p>\n<p>A full account of the anti-democratic activities of these companies must include their now extremely well-documented attempts to oppose and muddy the science on climate change through very large-scale propaganda efforts modelled on, and sometimes even using the same people as, the anti-science campaigns of the tobacco industry. Even as they have been forced to admit publicly to the human contribution to global warming, they have continued to fund organisations and individuals that work to create doubt in the public mind.<a href=\"#_ftn24\" name=\"_ftnref\">[24]</a> Among these funders of climate denial are companies with significant South African footprints, such as Shell, BP, Arcelor Mittal and Eskom.<a href=\"#_ftn25\" name=\"_ftnref\">[25]</a> On top of this, polluters use non-disclosure agreements to force silence on their victims, stifling informed public debate.<a href=\"#_ftn26\" name=\"_ftnref\">[26]</a></p>\n<h3>Fossil fuel dependence is bad for economies and societies, even before its contribution to climate change is considered</h3>\n<p>The World Health Organisation estimates that 3.7 million deaths annually are linked to outdoor air pollution (from various sources).<a href=\"#_ftn27\" name=\"_ftnref\">[27]</a></p>\n<p>The world’s dependence on fossil fuels is an enormous source of geopolitical and economic instability. Rising fossil fuel prices contribute to war, increased food prices and increased transport costs, with an undue burden on the poor. It is now widely acknowledged that the war in Iraq, estimated to have contributed to the deaths of over a million people, was waged in pursuit of oil.</p>\n<p>'I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: the Iraq war is largely about oil,’ <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/16/iraq.iraqtimeline\">wrote Alan Greenspan</a>, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank, in his memoirs.</p>\n<p>‘The US military is not in the Persian Gulf to protect oil destined for the US so much as to secure the oil supplies of Europe, Japan and South Korea, and to implicitly blackmail China,’ Michael Lind recently observed in <em>The Spectator</em>.<sup><a href=\"#_ftn28\" name=\"_ftnref\">[28]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, countries like Iceland, with a high proportion of renewables in their energy mix, are enjoying the consequent increased economic stability. As the Icelandic president, Olafur Rangar Grimsson, observes:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he development of a clean energy economy is a good insurance policy against long-term difficulties which inevitably will continue to follow the financial crises of the future; against making the downturns of economic cycles too painful.</blockquote>\n<h3>Divestment is a powerful tactic for stigmatising fossil fuel companies. Divestment helped make SA a democracy. Fossil fuel companies are becoming very sensitive to divestment pressure</h3>\n<p>Divestment is the process of using investment choices to withdraw funds from the rogue companies that are heavily invested in fossil fuels (particularly the 200 carbon majors identified by Carbon Tracker) and ideally reinvesting those funds in socially responsible, low carbon enterprises.</p>\n<p>Did divestment work as an anti-apartheid tactic? Twenty-five years on, opinions remain divided. But it seems some rather key observers agree that they were effective:</p>\n<blockquote>When I met FW de Klerk, the last president of the apartheid regime, in Chicago two years ago, he was clear: ‘When the divestment movement began, I knew that apartheid had to end.’ And when I met with Mandela in 1990 in New York, he said that divestment was a crucial factor in ending apartheid.<sup><a href=\"#_ftn29\" name=\"_ftnref\">[29]</a></sup></blockquote>\n<p>One study has concluded that ‘… direct impacts of fossil fuel divestment on equity or debt are likely to be limited.’ But also that ‘[t]he outcome of the stigmatisation process, which the fossil fuel divestment campaign has now triggered, poses the most far-reaching threat to fossil fuel companies and the vast energy value chain.’<sup><a href=\"#_ftn30\" name=\"_ftnref\">[30]</a></sup></p>\n<p>As author Naomi Klein observes, the power of divestment campaigns is that they are:</p>\n<blockquote>…taking aim at the moral legitimacy of fossil fuel companies and the profits that flow from them. This movement is saying that it is unethical to be associated with an industry whose business model is based on knowingly destabilising the planet’s life support systems.<sup><a href=\"#_ftn31\" name=\"_ftnref\">[31]</a></sup></blockquote>\n<p>Probably the most powerful indication that fossil fuel divestment could be effective is that the companies targeted are complaining about the divestment movement with increasing stridency. In Australia, the mining lobby has gone as far as to contemplate asking for a ban on divestment activism.<a href=\"#_ftn32\" name=\"_ftnref\"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>\n<h3>UCT is a leading centre of learning in South Africa and Africa and has already made strong commitments to sustainability and to addressing poverty and inequality.</h3>\n<p>UCT is a signatory to the ISCN-GULF Sustainable Campus Charter and the Tailloires Declaration, which states that ‘urgent actions are needed to address these fundamental problems’ of ‘environmental pollution and degradation, and the depletion of natural resources’. It is hard to reconcile continued investment in fossil fuels with these long-standing commitments. We hope that the university is ready to live up to the very specific words of these declarations and undertake correspondingly transformative action.</p>\n<p>This is, of course, far from being the only context in which the university has explicitly committed itself to transformative social engagement. The Vice-Chancellor writes on the UCT website that the university ‘has a proud tradition effecting social change and development’, and that UCT students ‘are introduced to a life of leadership and service through social engagement’.</p>\n<p>The UCT African Climate &amp; Development Initiative (ACDI) website<a href=\"#_ftn33\" name=\"_ftnref\">[33]</a> states that ‘Climate change is a fundamental threat to sustainable development and the fight against poverty’.</p>\n<p>UCT’s Poverty &amp; Inequality Initiative asks why inequality is deepening in South Africa – even as UCT profits from investments that inflict climate change on the poor!</p>\n<p>As Richard Calland<a href=\"#_ftn34\" name=\"_ftnref\"><sup>[34]</sup></a> said at the Fossil Free UCT launch on 30 July 2014:</p>\n<blockquote>Climate change hits the most vulnerable the hardest. Therefore it is about issues of equity, social responsibility, social justice… This is not an issue where there is a shortage of knowledge or a shortage of money. This is a matter where there is a shortage of will… We know how to fix it… It’s just a question of making the right decision to do so.</blockquote>\n<p>… Universities to my mind have a responsibility to lead because they have the intellectual horsepower, because they have the convening power, because they have a particular position and status in the community, because they have the responsibility to teach and to research.</p>\n<p>A university that has that knowledge, that has the ability to shine this light in the crevices of these difficult issues, has in my view a responsibility to act in a way that is consistent and that is not hypocritical… UCT runs the risk that its reputation will be sorely undermined if it continues to invest in fossil fuel industries.</p>\n<h3>It is morally wrong to be invested in fossil fuels. It is also likely a very poor investment.</h3>\n<p>There are increasing warnings coming from the economics and investment world over the dangers of being heavily invested in fossil fuels. If international negotiations lead to binding emissions reductions targets, the reserves on which the value of fossil fuels companies is based will become so-called ‘stranded assets’.</p>\n<p>The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/13/mark-carney-fossil-fuel-reserves-burned-carbon-bubble\">has said that</a> the ‘vast majority of reserves are unburnable’ if global temperature rises are to be limited to below 2 °C.</p>\n<p>The cofounder and chief investment strategist of Grantham Mayo van Otterloo, Jeremy Grantham, was identified by Bloomberg Markets in 2011 as one of 50 individuals having ‘the ability to move markets or shape ideas and policies’. He acquired particular renown after predicting and <a href=\"http://www.webcitation.org/6TOPO8RAX\">dodging the sub-prime bubble</a> in 2008. GMO manages over $150 billion in assets (roughly 400 times the size of the UCT endowment). In May 2013, he <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2013/02/13/jeremy-grantham-to-join-keystone-pipeline-protest/\">outlined the simple business case</a> for getting out of fossil fuels:</p>\n<blockquote>I believe anyone investing in tar sands is very likely to end up with stranded assets in the next decade or two. Solar is getting cheaper by the minute, whereas petroleum is getting more expensive. It is only a matter of time before their expenses cross.</blockquote>\n<p>Some market commentators are extremely worried that there is a possible bubble in the fossil fuel industry. A <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/10957292/Fossil-industry-is-the-subprime-danger-of-this-cycle.html\">landmark article</a> in the conservative UK <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, long the home of climate deniers and cheerleaders for fossil fuels, recently concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote>The epicentre of irrational behaviour across global markets has moved to the fossil fuel complex of oil, gas and coal. This is where investors have been throwing the most good money after bad. They are likely to be left holding a clutch of worthless projects as renewable technology sweeps in below radar, and the Washington-Beijing axis embraces a greener agenda.</blockquote>\n<p>Globally, the overall trend is for the costs of nuclear energy and fossil fuel generation to continue to increase, while the costs of renewables continue to decline. It seems most probable that the best investments are in the emerging technology. According to analysis by Citibank, in countries like Chile the so-called shale gas revolution is already taking a back seat to solar. The costs of solar energy have reached socket parity (equal cost to consumers) in many countries, and grid parity is approaching fast. ‘Solar is more affordable to develop in most regions globally.’<sup><a href=\"#_ftn35\" name=\"_ftnref\">[35]</a></sup></p>\n<p>However, even if divestment were to bring a hit on returns, that is preferable to the consequences if we continue on the fossil fuel path.</p>\n<p>In 2006, the Stern Review concluded that we should immediately invest 1% of world GDP to combat climate change. Otherwise, the resulting climate chaos could <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">cost</span> rise to costing 20% of world GDP per year.<a href=\"#_ftn36\" name=\"_ftnref\"><sup>[36]</sup></a> (Beyond that, the concept of GDP may cease to be meaningful.)</p>\n<h3>Divestment creates opportunities for creative reinvestment</h3>\n<p>‘The Age of Renewables is Beginning’ trumpets a headline – not from Greenpeace, but from Citibank.

But they need to pursue it because older generations, particularly leaders in big business and governments, are failing in their <em>responsibility</em> to act. Some in the university community have suggested that it is principally up to students to pursue this campaign. This is both an abdication of intergenerational responsibility and a failure to discharge their pastoral duty to the young people entrusted to them during their time at the university.</p>\n<p>There is also a growing international movement for recognition of the crime of ecocide, the wholesale destruction of biodiversity – which is both a cause and an effect of climate change.</p>\n<h3>Others are already acting. Will UCT be a laggard?</h3>\n<p>So far, 13 American universities have made commitments to varying degrees of divestment. Notably, Stanford University has committed itself to dropping all its coal investments. In October 2014, Glasgow University became the first European university to divest. Two Australian universities have divested. Cities that have committed to divestment include Seattle, San Francisco, Portland, Boulder, Oxford in the UK, and Dunedin in New Zealand. A great many churches, such as the Australian Anglican Church, as well as many foundations have also committed themselves to divestment.</p>\n<h3>Globally, support for divestment is growing fast</h3>\n<p>Key figures are also weighing in to support divestment. A statement from 190 faculty members at Harvard issued in April 2014 reads:</p>\n<blockquote> Our University invests in the fossil fuel industry: this is for us the central issue. We now know that fossil fuels cause climate change of unprecedented destructive potential. We also know that many in this industry spend large sums of money to mislead the public, deny climate science, control legislation and regulation, and suppress alternative energy sources.</blockquote>\n<p>‘Through policy reforms, we can divest and tax that which we don't want, the carbon that threatens development gains over the last 20 years,’ said World Bank president Jim Yong Kim at the 2014 World Economic Forum.</p>\n<p>Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, has said:</p>\n<blockquote>Investment decisions need to reflect the clear scientific evidence, and fiduciary responsibility needs to grasp the intergenerational reality: namely that unchecked climate change has the potential to impact and eventually devastate the lives, livelihoods and savings of many, now and well into the future.</blockquote>\n<p>US president Barack Obama, speaking on climate change at the University of California, Irvine in June 2014, has said: ‘You need to invest in what helps, and divest from what harms.’</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>There is almost universal agreement that climate change is the most urgent issue facing humanity.<sup><a href=\"#_ftn42\" name=\"_ftnref\">[42]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The onus is on those who argue against divestment to propose alternative strategies for breaking the political deadlock that we are up against.</p>\n<p>It appears that some on the UCT Council fear that if they respond to this particular call for socially responsible investing, the door will be opened to other issues. But it is both unlikely that any other issue quite as urgent as climate change will come knocking, and unlikely that the pursuit of broader socially responsible investing will hurt UCT’s long-term returns. As we have argued, it may even help them.</p>\n<p>The UCT Council obviously has a duty to manage the resources at its disposal to ensure that the university is able to meet its needs. But that responsibility cannot be discharged in a way that will add to the misery of Africa’s poor; that will contribute to compromising, if not destroying, future economic and social development; and that may leave today’s students highly qualified but stranded in a world of ever-increasing misery.</p>\n<p>The leader of <a href=\"http://350.org\">350.org</a>, Bill McKibben, who helped initiate the divestment movement, has described the simple logic of this campaign: ‘If it is wrong to wreck the planet, then it is also wrong to profit from the wreckage.</p>\n<p>Companies such as Sasol, BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Exxaro, Xstrata and Shell are corporate killers. They have known the effects of their business model for decades now, yet still fight change, despite earning vast profits that could be deployed into transforming their businesses.</p>\n<p>Archbishop Desmond Tutu, long the moral conscience of South Africa and a firm supporter of the international divestment campaign, has called on UCT to divest, saying, ‘I ask UCT to examine urgently the extent of your investments in fossil fuel companies and to make a strong commitment to phasing them out as soon as possible.’ During the UN climate summit in New York in September 2014, UCT’s own chancellor, Graça Machel, urged world leaders to ‘have the courage to tell business that it is not only about the profits but about our collective survival and wellbeing’.</p>\n<p>In a world where governments were responding quickly and competently with policies that matched the threat of climate change, there would be no need for UCT to divest. Unfortunately, we do not live in that world. UCT is a place of learning – and a place of privilege. Staff, students and faculty are arguably far better equipped than most South Africans to properly understand the climate issue and the need for action. A university is a place where we begin to create the future, not a place to participate in its destruction.</p>\n<p>If UCT is indeed the leading university on the continent most vulnerable to climate change, then we have a particularly urgent responsibility to act, and act swiftly. Given the pace of the international divestment movement, university leaders will probably not have to wait long to feel vindicated in what may feel today like an uncomfortable decision.</p>\n<p><em>– Please sign </em><a href=\"http://campaigns.gofossilfree.org/petitions/uct-to-divest-from-fossil-fuels-and-invest-in-sustainable-energy\"><em>our petition calling on UCT to divest</em></a><em>.

Stiglitz explained the issues: \"If we have poor measures, what we strive to do (say, increase GDP) may actually contribute to a worsening of living standards. We may also be confronted with false choices, seeing trade-offs between output and environmental protection that don’t exist. By contrast, a better measure of economic performance might show that steps taken to improve the environment are good for the economy.\"</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most striking critic of the misuse of GDP statistics was the man who devised them in the 1930s, the economist Simon Kuznets, who later emphasised that \"the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income\", and that \"goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what\".</p>\n<p>There are perhaps four key problems with the use and misuse of GDP figures.</p>\n<p>First, the implicit idea that growth is automatically good and can or should continue indefinitely is magical thinking on a par with the most egregious frauds perpetrated by quacks and some New Age thinkers. We live on a finite planet, with limited, increasingly overexploited resources and natural systems. We are alarmingly close to exhausting the economically retrievable portions of key resources such as oil, coal and phosphorus. But GDP measurements imply a universe of inexhaustible resources. Astonishingly, GDP does not account for depleted mineral resources, nor even for infrastructural degradation, much less for environmental damage, ignored as \"externalities\".</p>\n<p>\"Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist,\" observed systems thinker Kenneth Boulding.</p>\n<p>Second, the growth obsession obscures the real extent to which we are succeeding or failing as societies. Growth figures tell us nothing about equality, human rights or fundamental quality of life.</p>\n<p>The immense human and environmental costs of China’s runaway economic growth are visible to everyone who visits there — yet do not show up in GDP statistics.</p>\n<p>This leads us to the third problem — that growth can become uneconomic — destroying real prosperity even as it purports to create it. Former World Bank economist Herman Daly writes: \"Uneconomic growth occurs when increases in production come at an expense in resources and wellbeing that is worth more than the items made.\" This already holds true at a global level. The Global Footprint Network estimates that at some time in the 1980s, humanity pushed the earth into net environmental deficit — exploiting nature beyond its capacity for self-renewal.</p>\n<p>\"For years, statistics have registered an increasingly strong economic growth as a victory over shortage — until it emerged that this growth was destroying more than it was creating. The (global economic) crisis doesn’t only make us free to imagine other models, another future, another world. It obliges us to do so,\" said Sarkozy.</p>\n<p>Why is this? Perhaps because the heedless pursuit of growth is (fourth) inherently destabilising to economies. An example: in the years up to the 2008 crisis, the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates at unprecedented low levels to maintain US economic growth. The Fed’s efforts succeeded, but the growth that followed was funded not by national savings, but by debt — not least in the subprime mortgage market, which, as everyone knows, collapsed, creating the global economic crisis and immense human suffering.</p>\n<p>So what are the alternatives to our obsession with GDP and growth?</p>\n<p>We must distinguish between healthy and unhealthy growth and stick to the former. In nature, there is no such thing as healthy endless growth. Runaway growth in ecosystems ends in overnight population collapses. Medically, we call it cancer.</p>\n<p>We can distinguish between healthy and unhealthy economic growth. Unhealthy growth is unequally distributed, fuelling inequality. Unhealthy growth is excessively dependent on debt (financial or environmental) and is unsustainable because it invariably leads to financial and environmental collapses. Unhealthy growth is unjust and undemocratic — it defers the full costs of development to future generations. Unhealthy growth occurs without checks and balances, such as regulation.</p>\n<p>We need new measures of wellbeing that include social and environmental dimensions, that do justice to the dignity and unlimited value of life. Some believe a single but more inclusive metric can supplant GDP. Others fear that simplification might introduce new distortions and say we must pay attention to a full \"dashboard\" of indicators, as Germany has since 2010 with its 10 W3 Indicators. With three target dimensions — economy, ecology and social wealth — the W3 Indicators are \"GDP, income distribution, and government debt\"; \"greenhouse gases, nitrous oxide, and biodiversity\"; and \"employment, education, health, and freedom\".</p>\n<p>We need new priorities, as these W3 indicators suggest. Few developed countries need to expand their economies further to meet the real needs of their citizens. Efficiency, equality and sustainability are more important for them. Developing countries, including South Africa, may need further growth in some dimensions, but must stop considering growth a proxy solution for all our problems — it is madness when these problems, such as poverty and inequality, are barely dented by growth. It is good that our government talks about \"inclusive growth\" — but GDP does not measure inclusivity.</p>\n<p>We must ditch the misleading language of growth and recession. During Japan’s \"lost decades\" of low growth or contraction, its \"recessionary\" economy continued to meet people’s real needs far better than do many \"growing\" economies.</p>\n<p>The methodology for calculating GDP was published by the United Nations Statistical Office in 1993. It is not to blame for the misuse of GDP figures, but the methodology should be updated to produce something closer to what people imagine it means — an integrated reflection of the progress of nations.</p>\n<p>Last, we need a new habit — never cheering reflexively when we hear that there has been growth, but instead always (echoing Kuznets) asking: \"Growth of what, for whom, and at what cost?\"</p>",

But I have also been frustrated and perplexed by how few installers seem willing to even contemplate quoting on smaller-scale systems, while feeling certain something smaller scale was viable.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As it happens, we have purchased a substantial portion of the function we need at a fraction of the price that most people are laying out. (Of course, this isn’t delivering the electricity cost savings that a bigger system can deliver – but our decision to also install a solar water heater in August (for around R20,000) is helping substantially with that – and even with the nearly 20% price increase in July, our electricity costs have gone down.)</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-medium"><a href="https://lepage.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-2.jpeg"><figure class="wp-image-1004"><img loading="lazy" src="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/image-2.jpeg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/image-2-xs.jpeg 640w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/image-2-sm.jpeg 768w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/image-2-md.jpeg 1024w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/image-2-lg.jpeg 1366w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/image-2-xl.jpeg 1600w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/image-2-2xl.jpeg 1920w"></figure></a></figure><p></p><p></p><p>The DIY micro solar system comprises a 33Ah gel battery (R800), a 40w solar panel (R800), a <a href="https://www.takealot.com/aoits-30a-solar-charge-controller-3012/PLID91332707">30A solar charge controller (R600)</a>, a R300 12 volt micro-DB board, and 10 x <a href="https://www.synerji.co.za/product/synerji-led-gu10-6w-3000k-60deg-230v/">5 watt <em>warm white</em> LED lights (purchased at Plumstead Electrical</a>. We have two of these in the kitchen, two in the main bedroom, two in the dining/living room, and one each in children’s rooms, main bathroom and passage, one more planned for study.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It adds up to good lighting for the whole house on less electricity we all used to use for one bedside incandescent light (60w). The warm white downlighter LEDs I eventually found are really great, but it was very tricky finding fittings, as I didn't want to use downlighters everywhere. So I had to adapt 220 volt wall fittings for some of them; I’ve used them as downlighters in some instances, and some are hanging on wires from ceiling.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The aesthetics definitely still need attention – I need to hack lightshades now.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Many South Africans have resorted to using rechargeable lead-acid portable Magneto-branded lights – but I really, really wanted to get away from that horrid bleached-out cool white lighting that most of the Magneto lights have. The lighting quality of our backup system is now actually <em>better</em> in many instances than our warm white LED mains lighting.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Wiring has probably cost R1000 – low voltage wiring has to be quite heavy gauge. The cost of the wiring was probably one of the biggest surprises for me in this process – that cost could be reduced by shifting to a 24 volt system – but then where would one find 24 volt bulbs? Finding decent 12 volt bulbs in South Africa was hard enough, and involved endless calls and googling and testing (I started out buying just three bulbs and seeing if they worked as hoped for).</p><p></p><p></p><p>It took me ages and a lot of crawling around the attic to figure everything out and source components and install wiring, so took about three months to build in stages – I started with just two LEDs wired up to the battery – and I am still tweaking. I built most of the lighting before connecting up the panel, recharging the battery periodically with a R300 mains charger. But we’ve been fully operational with the solar panel for about six weeks now, and I’ve never since needed to top up with mains.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Of course, this setup isn’t powering any appliances – our cooking is still down to planning around loadshedding, filling a flask with hot water, and sometimes using a gas camping stove – but for up to stage 4/5 of loadshedding, we’re mostly fine. To ensure we don’t run out of battery power, I make sure I don’t turn everything on all at the same time, which is easy as we migrate from living spaces to bedrooms in the evenings; and in the mornings, we never need lights for more than two hours.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It’s the kind of lighting system N. Americans put in their over-the-top vans – and still very modest by that standard! – stretched out over a house.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Our internet – fibre box and router – could run off this system, but that mostly works fine on an <a href="https://www.takealot.com/gizzu-8800mah-mini-ups-dual-dc/PLID71930088">R800 lithium battery/micro-UPS</a> that we’ve had for two years now that typically lasts at least six hours before needing re-charging. But I do also use the 12 volt system to run an old wifi router repurposed as an Internet range extender that sits in the attic and gives us coverage in parts of the property we never had it before even during loadshedding.</p><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><figure class="wp-image-1021 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/img_6268.jpeg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/img_6268-xs.jpeg 640w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/img_6268-sm.jpeg 768w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/img_6268-md.jpeg 1024w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/img_6268-lg.jpeg 1366w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/img_6268-xl.jpeg 1600w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/58/responsive/img_6268-2xl.jpeg 1920w"></figure></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"><p></p><p>Repurposed router in the attic serving as range extender</p><p></p></div></div><p></p><p></p><p>I’m not a qualified electrician, but I've shown my setup to two visiting electricians and it seems I've got most things right enough. I do have overload protection on all the main loads (again, these are less than the power drawn by an old 60 watt incandescent bedside lamp), and a fuse on the solar panel circuit, and I’ve been pretty careful. I have had to teach myself <em>a lot</em> as the project advanced: my abundant childhood tinkering with soldering irons and batteries and twisted wire connections did not prepare me for this project.</p><p></p><p></p><p>From what I’ve read in local forums and in the reviews of some of the products I bought on Takealot for this project, there are lots of people out there in SA who have similar systems for home – or camping! – but it’s still really not widely understood as an option. If you were to get an electrician to build it, it would probably take a day's work and labour costs accordingly. I'm pretty certain someone resourceful and with more time than I have could build a good business offering this kind of system on the market.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Besides my lack of knowledge (slowly accumulated via websites and YouTube), another thing that took time was that I just couldn’t get all the necessary components in one place: in the end, my battery and panel came from China Town in Ottery (bought in March in something of a panic over the prospect of grid blackout); LEDs and wire from Plumstead lighting, switches from Yebo Electronics, charge controller (returned two before I got a decent one) and micro-DB board and crimping tool and more wire from Takealot, crimp connectors from Kismet Hardware and Micra Hardware.<br><br>Postscript: It's often suggested – quite strongly suggested – that to avert the unpleasant effects of allowing the "<a href="http://www.igbp.net/globalchange/greatacceleration.4.1b8ae20512db692f2a680001630.html">great acceleration</a>" to continue to the point of economic and ecological collapse, we need to moderate or even "de-grow" economies at some point. Working on this project has reminded me just how much most contemporary structures were built with the assumption that they could be lit, heated and cooled with abundant cheap fossil-derived energy – and how even at a domestic level, we can in fact "de-grow" without great sacrifice.</p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on August 3, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/tags/posts/">Posts</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdavidlepage.github.io%2Fhow-i-built-a-r6000-micro-solar-12-volt-backup-lighting-system-for-our-cape-town-home%2F" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=How%20I%20built%20a%20R6000%20micro-solar%2012%20volt%20backup%20lighting%20system%20for%20our%20Cape%20Town%20home https%3A%2F%2Fdavidlepage.github.io%2Fhow-i-built-a-r6000-micro-solar-12-volt-backup-lighting-system-for-our-cape-town-home%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/authors/david-le-page/" rel="author">David Le Page</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/events-at-nkandla-remind-me-of-another-south-african-near-insurrection/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/57/responsive/image_2021-07-07_230623-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1704" width="1704"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> Events at Nkandla remind me of another South African near-insurrection</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/the-western-torment-of-gaza/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The Western torment of Gaza</div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/59/responsive/Gaza-UNWRA-May2024-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="Aerial photograph of Gaza coastline, the gray hellscape of destroyed buildings receding into the distance alongside a calm sea" height="530" width="530"></figure></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/authors/david-le-page/" class="feed__author">David Le Page</a> <time datetime="2010-08-09T20:57" class="feed__date">August 9, 2010</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/sunday-times-can-we-fight-corruption-in-a-world-thats-built-on-greed/">Sunday Times: &#x27;Can we fight corruption in a world that&#x27;s built on greed?&#x27;</a></h3></header><figure class="size-full wp-image-258"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/24/khayelitsha.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="Khayelitsha, Cape Town" src="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/24/khayelitsha.jpg" alt="Khayelitsha, Cape Town" width="500" height="220" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/24/responsive/khayelitsha-xs.jpg 640w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/24/responsive/khayelitsha-sm.jpg 768w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/24/responsive/khayelitsha-md.jpg 1024w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/24/responsive/khayelitsha-lg.jpg 1366w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/24/responsive/khayelitsha-xl.jpg 1600w, https://davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/24/responsive/khayelitsha-2xl.jpg 1920w"></a></figure><p></p><p><em>Published in the </em><a href="http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article591136.ece/Can-we-fight-corruption-in-a-world-thats-built-on-greed">Sunday Times</a><em>, 8 August 2010</em> <strong></strong></p><p><strong>The only way to stop the rot is to create a fair society</strong></p><p>Man, are we ever in a stew over corruption. The issue is in the news every day, bloggers have launched an online reporting initiative called the Meerkat Corruption Project, newspapers are beefing up their investigative units... and it might all be pointless.</p><p>We shouldn’t feel too insecure about our corruption in comparison to some other nations. The United States Congress is a filthy stew of special interests that makes a mockery of “We, the people” and compromises not just the interests and wellbeing of ordinary Americans, but of the whole world. US warmongering is a murderous subsidy system for the military-industrial complex; US climate imperialism threatens the entire human race to preserve the pollution “rights” of American fossil fuel interests. (Obama’s leading economic adviser, Larry Summers, believes Africa is “under-polluted”.)</p><p>No bill passes Congress these days without being laden with appropriations called “earmarks”, really payoffs to the favourite special interests of individual legislators. Corrupt US legislators are currently refusing to pass legislation either to ease US unemployment or to reduce the universal threat of climate change.</p><p>So the US is hardly less corrupt than we are, but its rulers are better at corruption: they've written it into law and spin it well. So too, to a good degree, the British. Tony Blair supported the illegal Iraq war, blocked enquiries into dodgy arms deals, and appears to have released the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing in order to secure access to Libyan oil for BP. No envelopes of cash need have changed hands for us to call this corrupt.</p><p>But struggling young democracies should not or seek find consolation in the failures of the old.

Pic: The Presidency</div><p>It's not unusual to hear South Africans smugly declaring the globe-straddling superiority of our constitution – but when did you last hear someone saying, "We've got the world's finest Electoral Act and the most independently-minded, accountable Members of Parliament: men and women who know their minds and speak them without hesitation."</p><p>The Constitution specifies that we have an National Assembly, and that we all get to vote for it. But it's the Electoral Act that defines the process by which our Members of Parliament are selected – the accuracy, or crudeness, with which our desires as voters are translated into representives – and we don't have one.</p><p>Well, we do, sort of. We have the left-over, provisional arrangements made for the 1994 election. When the framers of the Constitution finished off their work in 1996, they also said a new Electoral Act must be in place by 1999. But somehow, no one quite got round to it.</p><p>Which is why Dr F Van Zyl Slabbert, who headed the Electoral Task Team (ETT) which made proposals for a new Electoral Act in 2003, could write then that, 'Technically speaking we are without an electoral system'.</p><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/mps-electoral-systems-and-accountability-in-south-africa/" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

Sadly, this is not that article and that day, if it ever comes, is a long way in the future. Though climate change has largely disappeared from the public agenda in South Africa since the 17th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP-17) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Durban in December 2011, the problem itself remains stubbornly immune to fluctuations in media attention.</p><p>Two recent climate-change updates from the World Bank and International Energy Agency have restated the scale and dangers of the problem. The reports should make anyone younger than 50 worry about the future, because, on present emissions trends, significant effects are predicted in just the next 30 years. Some of the worst effects will hit sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>There are a few points to bear in mind when either contemplating or skipping in dread past the predictions. First, global carbon emissions are still growing and show no sign of slowing down.</p><a href="./../../../../new-alerts-highlight-need-for-urgent-climate-change-action.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./../../../../authors/david-le-page/" class="feed__author">David Le Page</a> <time datetime="2013-07-02T18:52" class="feed__date">July 2, 2013</time></div><h2 class="feed__title"><a href="./../../../../sa-must-build-economic-democracy.html">&#x27;SA must build economic democracy&#x27;</a></h2></header><p><em><a title="Link to article on the M&amp;G website" href="http://mg.co.za/article/2013-06-21-00-sa-must-build-economic-democracy">Published</a> in the Mail &amp; Guardian, 21 June 2013</em></p><figure class="alignright size-medium wp-image-636"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../../media/posts/45/p8073931.jpg" alt="This is not Constantia." width="300" height="156" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./../../../../media/posts/45/responsive/p8073931-xs.jpg 640w, ./../../../../media/posts/45/responsive/p8073931-sm.jpg 768w, ./../../../../media/posts/45/responsive/p8073931-md.jpg 1024w, ./../../../../media/posts/45/responsive/p8073931-lg.jpg 1366w, ./../../../../media/posts/45/responsive/p8073931-xl.jpg 1600w, ./../../../../media/posts/45/responsive/p8073931-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure>Twenty years after this country chose to end relentless violence and injustice by introducing political democracy, our rightwing government is ready to roll out the troops and subdue mineworkers by force of arms. But the only lasting remedy for the discontent on the mines is to make South Africa an economic democracy.<p></p><p>Currently, South Africa is being crushed by economic totalitarianism. Few of us realise this, and few of us know that there are alternatives, many of them up and running in other countries.</p><p>Economic democracy is about ensuring that everyone in society, not just the elites, has a meaningful share in the wealth of the country, and a voice in deciding how that wealth is shared. It’s a term that has emerged from nearly two centuries of worker mobilisation in Europe, the United States and Latin America.</p><p>It’s particularly necessary in South Africa because of our history of colonialism and apartheid. To paraphrase Walter Rodney, most South Africans are not underdeveloped, they have been underdeveloped.

But commentators and government representatives get rather shy when it comes to talking about real solutions. They take refuge in calls for ‘solidarity’, ‘symbolic steps’, ‘dialogue’ and, as ever, ‘poverty reduction’.</p><p>These calls are at best timid and ignorant of the real nature of inequality, and at worst, evasive.</p><p>Eight thousand kilometres from Nkandla, the Uruguayan president, Jose Mujica, eschews his official residence for his wife’s shabby old farmhouse, and gives a large portion of his salary to the poor. That’s real solidarity.</p><p>But since we’re not yet seeing that kind of solidarity here, let’s talk frankly about two things: Firstly, the ways in which the very existence of excessive wealth actually creates poverty, and secondly, what some real solutions might look like.</p><a href="./../../../../fix-inequality-with-a-maximum-wage.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="./../../../../authors/david-le-page/" class="feed__author">David Le Page</a> <time datetime="2012-11-19T07:46" class="feed__date">November 19, 2012</time></div><h2 class="feed__title"><a href="./../../../../business-day-south-africa-needs-a-business-alliance-to-protect-biodiversity.html">Business Day: &#x27;South Africa needs a business alliance to protect biodiversity&#x27;</a></h2></header><figure class="alignright size-medium wp-image-563"><a href="http://lepage.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/img_5915-copy.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5915 copy" src="./../../../../media/posts/43/img_5915-copy.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./../../../../media/posts/43/responsive/img_5915-copy-xs.jpg 640w, ./../../../../media/posts/43/responsive/img_5915-copy-sm.jpg 768w, ./../../../../media/posts/43/responsive/img_5915-copy-md.jpg 1024w, ./../../../../media/posts/43/responsive/img_5915-copy-lg.jpg 1366w, ./../../../../media/posts/43/responsive/img_5915-copy-xl.jpg 1600w, ./../../../../media/posts/43/responsive/img_5915-copy-2xl.jpg 1920w"></a></figure><em><a href="http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/2012/11/18/south-africa-needs-a-business-alliance-that-protects-biodiversity">Published in </a></em><a href="http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/2012/11/18/south-africa-needs-a-business-alliance-that-protects-biodiversity">Business Day</a><em><a href="http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/2012/11/18/south-africa-needs-a-business-alliance-that-protects-biodiversity">, 19 November 2012</a></em> THE other day, I spotted a small flurry of activity just outside my front door.

But do we have the world’s best parliament? Hm...<p></p><p>So what would a really great parliament look like?</p><p>Well, we’d probably have members of parliament (MPs) who run strong constituency offices and are visible in the communities they represent. They would be standing up regularly for the rights of the vulnerable. Like MPs in the UK and members of congress in the US, they’d have no hesitation in criticising the leaders of their own parties or big businesses that abuse their power and influence. But unlike US congresspeople, they would not be receiving enormous amounts of money from special interests and handing out endless favours in return. Unlike the British government, they would not be giving more attention to the needs of bankers than to those of ordinary people.</p><p>We have good people in our parliament, but who knows of a South African MP like that?

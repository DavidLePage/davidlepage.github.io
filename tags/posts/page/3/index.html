My own pic.<p></p><p><strong>I: Cute notion, but neither fashionable nor persuasive. Try again.</strong></p><p>P: There are many arguments, and many who argue, against war on Iraq. There are a very few courageous souls who do so on the basis that war might actually be An Inherently Very Bad Thing, or even Wrong. Are they correct? Confusion on this point has beset humanity for too long. But let us (copping-out perhaps) stick to practical arguments against war — there are more than enough of them.</p><p>All wars are messy and brutal, cause death and great suffering and have nasty unforeseen consequences. A war on Iraq will be no exception.</p><p><strong>I: Surely the consequences of allowing Saddam Hussein to continue as World's Nastiest Dictator will be great suffering if he is allowed to continue amassing, and uses, weapons of mass destruction?</strong></p><p>P: If he attempted war, he would face overwhelming military force from the US and allies. He leads a moderately-sized country with a devastated economy, and armed forces stuck, for the most part, with ageing military technology. He cannot possibly hope to gain anything from going to war.</p><p>The CIA considers the risks of an unprovoked attack by Iraq on the US "low", but suggests he might lash out with WMDs in advance of an imminent US attack (thus preempting the preempters). <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031022194705/http://www.bluegreenprint.co.za/bgparchives/tenet">(32)</a></p><p><strong>I: Saddam went to war with Iran in the 1980s, and invaded Kuwait in 1990. He's waged brutal war internally against the Kurds and marsh Arabs. What's to stop him doing it all over again?</strong></p><p>P: He has shown no signs of external aggression since the Gulf War. His means of waging war are smaller than during the Gulf War; the US has spent another 10 years developing ever more sophisticated weapons. He can have no doubt that any external attack would end in overwhelming defeat. His regime, morally bankrupt as it is, is a state. States tend to behave far more rationally, particularly with respect to self-preservation, than the likes of al Quaeda. They can be, and are, deterred by the threat of force. His motives for hanging onto weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), if he is, are now probably the same as US motives for having such weapons: he wants to deter attack (being none too popular with the neighbours).</p><p>It has been argued that Saddam only invaded Kuwait on the nod from then US Ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie. In other words, that the US is directly responsible for one of his major acts of past aggression.</p><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/a-briefing-against-war-on-iraq/" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/tags/posts/page/2/" class="btn btn--icon"><span>Next</span> <svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></a></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

And when the media fail to communicate this crisis, they are complicit in crimes against humanity.</p><p>South Africa hosts companies that claim to be concerned about climate change - yet their international colleagues fund climate change deniers in the US Congress. Such behaviour, by ArcelorMittal, BP, Bayer and others, is dangerous and disgraceful.</p><p>The past year has seen unprecedented wild fires in Russia and huge floods in Pakistan, China and Australia (also hit by a cyclone). China faces a drought that may send world food prices soaring even higher. The Amazon basin was so stressed that it was a net natural emitter of carbon dioxide.</p><p>This climate breakdown is now directly destroying the lives and livelihoods of millions and affecting all the rest of us.</p><p>Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman writes that "what really stands out is the extent to which severe weather events have disrupted agricultural production ... the current food price surge may be just the beginning".</p><p>In December, Durban hosts the next round of international climate negotiations, COP 17. The negotiations could be vitally important, but are so bankrupt that at last year's round of talks in Cancun, delegates gave a standing ovation to an agreement that watered down earlier concords and leaves the world on track for a disastrous 3ºCor 4ºC of warming this century.</p><p>This means a possible average of 6ºC in Africa, and that, in the words of analyst Martin Khor, means we in Africa "are dead". There is little chance of "adapting" to six degrees.</p><p>Many like to vilify climate change sceptics and deniers. But who is most deserving of vilification? Those who deny the reality of climate change or those governments and multinationals who acknowledge it, but fail to take serious action?</p><p>You would think every country in the world would by now have a target for becoming carbon neutral, but only a handful do.</p><p>You would think that global subsidies for fossil fuels would have ended. But such subsidies remain 10 times the subsidies for clean energy.</p><p>You would think that energy companies that continue to make a fortune out of fossil fuels would feel a moral duty to invest in renewable energy - but the likes of BP and Shell spend a pittance on renewables.</p><p>What absurdities, besides the dismal pledges, still underlie the UN climate negotiations? Well, they focus on carbon dioxide. But black carbon and methane emissions are also badly in need of attention.</p><p>Then there's "common but differentiated responsibilities": the notion that rich countries should be cutting emissions hard and fast, but developing countries can still do a whole lot more polluting while catching up economically.</p><p>But the rich are not cutting hard and fast enough, if at all, and the notion of a "right to pollute" is a surreal absurdity, equivalent to a right to commit suicide.</p><p>So long as we developing countries claim to have an equal right to pollute, we take a morally bankrupt position where the rich are all too happy to have us.</p><p>South Africa is the world's 13th-biggest emitter. But we insist we will only cut emissions if paid to do so, joining the moral race to the gutter.</p><p>Then there's the notion of "adaptation". Rich countries love to promise that they will give aid to poor countries for "adapting" to climate change.</p><p>And, yes, adaptation is possible and necessary - so long as temperature increases are not too great. But when we face 4ºCto 6ºC of warming, "adaptation funding" (assuming it ever materialises, which is highly unlikely) is rather like rich passengers on an overcrowded ship telling the poor that they should happily jump into an icy sea because they're now being offered fancier life-jackets.</p><p>The greatest delusion is that measures to deal with climate change must not affect economic growth. But GDP worship, indiscriminate growth, is killing us. Greater shared prosperity is still possible, indeed essential, and in many instances, action on climate change will greatly help true development - but many economies must be scaled down, not up, and made far more equal.</p><p>There is a wonderful way out of this crisis - creating truly just, equal and sustainable societies.</p><p>Credible scientists have outlined detailed plans for converting the world to renewable energy over the next 40 years.</p><p>Ethiopia is committed to being a zero-carbon economy in just 15. But the transformation we need demands that we are clear that climate breakdown is not a technical or economic problem. It is a profound moral issue - the most urgent challenge to our humanity. We have the technology; it is our hearts that fail us.</p><p>Only one government in the world tells the whole truth about climate change. Bolivia refused to endorse the deal at the negotiations in Cancun - so has been vilified, even in sections of a global environmental movement which, in many instances, has lost its way.</p><p>It is past time we called to account those willing to wreck the planet for short-term profit. Bolivia and swathes of global civil society have called for an international climate justice tribunal. South Africa should commit to ending its fossil-fuel addiction and support that call. Parliament must urgently convene justice hearings so that we can begin bringing our own climate criminals to account. Our collective survival depends on it.</p><p><em>Le Page is a freelance writer working part time at the Southern African Faith Communities' Environment Institute</em></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on July 31, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdavidlepage.github.io%2Fdavidlepage.github.io%2Fsunday-times-stop-these-crimes-against-humanity.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Sunday%20Times%3A%20'Stop%20these%20crimes%20against%20humanity' https%3A%2F%2Fdavidlepage.github.io%2Fdavidlepage.github.io%2Fsunday-times-stop-these-crimes-against-humanity.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/authors/david-le-page/" rel="author">David Le Page</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/sunday-times-save-us-from-the-super-rich.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Sunday Times: &#x27;Save us from the super-rich&#x27;</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/climate-justice-for-sustainable-peace-in-africa.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> &#x27;Climate justice for sustainable peace in Africa&#x27;</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/authors/david-le-page/" class="feed__author">David Le Page</a> <time datetime="2010-10-10T17:41" class="feed__date">October 10, 2010</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/sunday-times-save-us-from-the-super-rich.html">Sunday Times: &#x27;Save us from the super-rich&#x27;</a></h3></header><figure class="alignright size-full wp-image-272"><img loading="lazy" title="Robin Hood cartoon: We have a job for your merry men." src="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/28/701116_632881_1146218b.jpg" alt="Robin Hood cartoon: We have a job for your merry men." width="300" height="238" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/28/responsive/701116_632881_1146218b-xs.jpg 640w, https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/28/responsive/701116_632881_1146218b-sm.jpg 768w, https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/28/responsive/701116_632881_1146218b-md.jpg 1024w, https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/28/responsive/701116_632881_1146218b-lg.jpg 1366w, https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/28/responsive/701116_632881_1146218b-xl.jpg 1600w, https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/media/posts/28/responsive/701116_632881_1146218b-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><em>Published by </em><a href="http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article698366.ece/Save-us-from-the-super-rich">The Sunday Times,</a><em> 10 October 2010</em><p></p><p><strong>The very rich are a danger to the environment, democracy, economic empowerment and themselves, says David Le Page</strong></p><p>Rich people are becoming a luxury we can no longer afford.

The fact is that all the evidence and experience of other countries that have succeeded in building more sustainable and healthy societies suggests that a class of super-rich people is not part of the solution.

Indeed, the government is making efforts to deal with poverty, such as the Community Work Programme now managed from the Department of Co-operative Governance.

The United States Congress is a filthy stew of special interests that makes a mockery of “We, the people” and compromises not just the interests and wellbeing of ordinary Americans, but of the whole world. US warmongering is a murderous subsidy system for the military-industrial complex; US climate imperialism threatens the entire human race to preserve the pollution “rights” of American fossil fuel interests. (Obama’s leading economic adviser, Larry Summers, believes Africa is “under-polluted”.)</p><p>No bill passes Congress these days without being laden with appropriations called “earmarks”, really payoffs to the favourite special interests of individual legislators. Corrupt US legislators are currently refusing to pass legislation either to ease US unemployment or to reduce the universal threat of climate change.</p><p>So the US is hardly less corrupt than we are, but its rulers are better at corruption: they've written it into law and spin it well. So too, to a good degree, the British. Tony Blair supported the illegal Iraq war, blocked enquiries into dodgy arms deals, and appears to have released the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing in order to secure access to Libyan oil for BP.

There are a very few courageous souls who do so on the basis that war might actually be An Inherently Very Bad Thing, or even Wrong. Are they correct? Confusion on this point has beset humanity for too long. But let us (copping-out perhaps) stick to practical arguments against war — there are more than enough of them.</p><p>All wars are messy and brutal, cause death and great suffering and have nasty unforeseen consequences. A war on Iraq will be no exception.</p><p><strong>I: Surely the consequences of allowing Saddam Hussein to continue as World's Nastiest Dictator will be great suffering if he is allowed to continue amassing, and uses, weapons of mass destruction?</strong></p><p>P: If he attempted war, he would face overwhelming military force from the US and allies. He leads a moderately-sized country with a devastated economy, and armed forces stuck, for the most part, with ageing military technology. He cannot possibly hope to gain anything from going to war.</p><p>The CIA considers the risks of an unprovoked attack by Iraq on the US "low", but suggests he might lash out with WMDs in advance of an imminent US attack (thus preempting the preempters). <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031022194705/http://www.bluegreenprint.co.za/bgparchives/tenet">(32)</a></p><p><strong>I: Saddam went to war with Iran in the 1980s, and invaded Kuwait in 1990. He's waged brutal war internally against the Kurds and marsh Arabs. What's to stop him doing it all over again?</strong></p><p>P: He has shown no signs of external aggression since the Gulf War. His means of waging war are smaller than during the Gulf War; the US has spent another 10 years developing ever more sophisticated weapons. He can have no doubt that any external attack would end in overwhelming defeat. His regime, morally bankrupt as it is, is a state. States tend to behave far more rationally, particularly with respect to self-preservation, than the likes of al Quaeda. They can be, and are, deterred by the threat of force. His motives for hanging onto weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), if he is, are now probably the same as US motives for having such weapons: he wants to deter attack (being none too popular with the neighbours).</p><p>It has been argued that Saddam only invaded Kuwait on the nod from then US Ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie. In other words, that the US is directly responsible for one of his major acts of past aggression.</p><a href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/a-briefing-against-war-on-iraq.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://davidlepage.github.io/davidlepage.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

Affairs<br>dealing with the small problem of being a whale.<br>I am a queue in myself and this distresses<br>the large number of people<br>thumping at my flukes outside the doors.</p><p>I wish to apply for a license to exist<br>since humans seem to be the ones occasionally issuing them,<br>though mostly you withhold them.</p><p>I am a southern right whale (at Home Affairs).<br>The whale ahead of me in the line is definitely the wrong whale.<br>This was my idea, I mentioned it to him in passing.<br>He jeered, yet the first finely tuned vibrations<br>from a nicely scrubbed factory ship had him jumping the queue.<br>The bastard.</p><p>Still, perhaps it shows<br>that I am not an isolated case.</p><p>I wish to argue that<br>I am charming, unique, picturesque, and large:<br>murdering me is a matter of engineering and dismemberment, of logistics.<br>Also, scientists believe I have something resembling language.<br>I pose a whole range of scientific questions<br>and if my value to myself has been ruled out by default<br>then perhaps my value to science<br>is a decent fallback position in arguing<br>my right to exist without some crisp, sunny day<br>being interrupted by a two-metre steel stake through the head.*</p><p>Just imagine how much intellectual property<br>might be waiting in my genome,<br>how many tourists might I yet pull to Hout Bay and Hermanus,<br>how many insurance claims will arise from<br>my sudden appearances near Main Road in Glencairn?</p><p>I am a whale at Home Affairs.<br>There is a small problem of language here<br>and I am waiting patiently while clerks Nonkosi Smith and Justin Pienaar<br>listen to the refrain from “we are the world”<br>for the fifteenth time on the Department of the Environment hotline.<br>The helpline is intended for citizens willing to thrash against bureaucracy.<br>Justin and Nonkosi seek advice for civil servants confronted with whales.<br>The babies whose mothers are in the queue to collect IDs<br>howl as I roll my drying saucer eyes at them.<br>Some Somalis are clicking quietly over a Xhosa language book.</p><p>It is going to be tricky to make<br>my application for continued existence,<br>as you cannot understand me.<br>The dolphins have succeeded in mastering<br>some of your squawks and grunts,<br>though you have yet to master any of their squeaks and whistles and so –<br>I will whisper this as I do not wish to offend and so harm my case –<br>I am not quite sure of the basis of your claim to superior intelligence.</p><p>Yes, I know you have all these buildings, machines, artifacts, etc.<br>But since their use is killing not only us but yourselves,<br>I feel those of us who forswear such gizmos<br>pose a case for intelligence that has yet to be answered.</p><p>I am a whale at Home Affairs and<br>I am having trouble breathing and my skin –<br>I am everywhere in pain. This is somewhat scary.<br>Soon, I am hoping, people in tie-dyed shirts from Scarboro<br>and others in wetsuits from Muizenberg will arrive<br>to pour water on me and the queue jumper.</p><p>The water will not go down well with Home Affairs security.</p><p>The tie-dye people are nice,<br>they don’t need spreadsheets showing<br>how many red balls were pushed<br>through the red hoop by Snowball at Seaworld<br>before they will decide that I have a case.</p><p>They will have to get past the cows though.<br>Damn. Word has spread, you see.<br>My idiosyncratic notion that we non-human beings<br>should apply for licenses to live has somehow gone viral.<br>Other species want in.<br>A small herd of bovines is advancing with purpose past Caledon Square.</p><p>Cats and dogs will be last to join the queue.<br>They will come even behind the Shangaans<br>explaining that they too are South African.<br>They think they are special.<br>I fear the cows have plans for them, though.</p><p>I am a whale at Home Affairs.<br>There are other species, too,<br>all shape and manner of beings who cannot get here.<br>And some who are here, but too small for you to see.<br>Some who are being vacuumed up behind me as we speak.</p><p>There is a great tide of life pulling<br>back out of the world drawn<br>by the dark moon of your ambitions.</p><p>If you could see what we sing in our songs,<br>if you too remembered with your hearts,<br>you would know what treasures this world still held<br>before you fell in love with things.</p><p>but you are creating deserts,<br>deserts on land and greater deserts<br>under the vast unquiet waters</p><p>I am a whale at Home Affairs.<br>I can tell you that flying through the great watery abyssals<br>feeling the songs of the world past and future<br>sung by brethren 3,000 miles away playing over your skin,<br>as strange glowing creatures far below you<br>form their own constellations<br>is an experience that someone,<br>something should be having and that for the meantime,<br>I feel I am one of those most highly qualified for this privilege<br>but also that being alive,<br>even for the most apparently insignificant of creatures<br>is a treasure unsurpassed and one you should not lightly take away</p><p>I am just a whale at Home Affairs<br>I am telling you what I see and I am asking if we all can live, please –<br>except for the bastard in front of me.</p><p>* While right whales are in fact no longer being hunted, human activities, not least ship strikes, pose a continued threat to them. It is also possible the speaker identifies with genus as much as with species.</p><p>2010</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://davidlepage.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
